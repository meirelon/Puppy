Akita,there is debate among fanciers whether there are two separate breeds of to date only the american kennel club 4 and the canadian kennel club citation needed consider american and japanese s to be two varieties of the same breed allowing free breeding between the two the united kennel club 5 the federation cynologique internationale 6 the kennel club 7 8 the australian national kennel council 9 the new zealand kennel club 10 11 and the japan kennel club citation needed consider japanese and american s as separate breeds 12 some countries refer to the american as simply the and not the american the issue is especially controversial in japan 13 for the fci s 84 countries the breed split formally occurred june 1999 when the fci decided that the american type would be called the great japanese dog 12 later renamed the american in january 2006 12 the story of hachik the most revered of all time helped push the into the international dog world hachiko was born in 1923 and owned by professor hidesabur ueno of tokyo 15 professor ueno lived near the shibuya train station in a suburb of the city and commuted to work every day on the train 16 hachik accompanied his master to and from the station each day 16 on may 25 1925 when the dog was 18 months old he waited for his master s arrival on the four o clock train but professor ueno had suffered a fatal brain haemorrhage at work 16 hachik continued to wait for his master s return 16 he travelled to and from the station each day for the next nine years 16 he allowed the professor s relatives to care for him but he never gave up the vigil at the station for his master 16 his vigil became world renowned when in 1934 17 shortly before his death a bronze statue was erected at the shibuya train station in his honor 16 this statue was melted down for munitions during the war but a new one was commissioned after the war 17 each year on april 8 since 1936 hachik s devotion has been honoured with a solemn ceremony of remembrance at tokyo s shibuya railroad station 18 19 eventually hachik s legendary faithfulness became a national symbol of loyalty particularly to the person and institution of the emperor 20 the japanese and american began to diverge in type during the postworld war ii era citation needed it was during this time that us servicemen serving as part of the occupation force in japan first came into contact with the the breed so impressed them that many soldiers chose to bring an back home with them upon completion of their tour citation needed american soldiers were typically more impressed with the larger more bear like fighting or german shepherd type than they were with the smaller framed and fox like inu the types of dogs they brought back with them to the us reflected this sentiment citation needed japanese fanciers focused on restoring the breed as a work of japanese art or to natural monument status citation needed american fanciers chose to breed larger heavier boned and more intimidating dogs citation needed although both types derive from a common ancestry there are marked differences between the two 31 first while american s are acceptable in all colors japanese s are only permitted to be red fawn sesame white or brindle citation needed additionally american s may be pinto and or have black masks unlike japanese s where it is considered a disqualification and not permitted in the breed standards citation needed american s generally are heavier boned and larger with a more bear like head whereas japanese s tend to be lighter and more finely featured with a fox like head 12 there are two coat types in the the standard coat length and the long coat 37 the long coat is considered a fault in the show ring however 37 the long coat also known as moku is the result of an autosomal recessive gene and may only occur phenotypically if both sire and dam are carriers they have longer about 34 inches in length and softer coats 38 and are known to have sweeter temperaments 37 it is believed that this gene comes from the now extinct karafuto ken 39 the inu ken is a large breed of dog originating from the mountainous northern regions of japan there are two separate varieties of a japanese strain commonly called ken in japan inu inu means dog in japanese or japanese and an american strain known as the or american 2 the japanese strain called the inu comes in a narrow palette of colors with all other colors considered atypical of the breed while the american strain known simply as the comes in all dog colors 3 the has a short double coat similar to that of many other northern spitz breeds such as the siberian husky but long coated dogs can be found in many litters due to a recessive gene as a spitz breed the appearance of the reflects cold weather adaptations essential to their original function 32 the is a substantial breed for its height with heavy bones citation needed characteristic physical traits of the breed include a large bear like head with erect triangular ears set at a slight angle following the arch of the neck citation needed additionally the eyes of the are small dark deeply set and triangular in shape 33 s have thick double coats and tight well knuckled cat like feet citation needed their tails are carried over the top of the back in a gentle or double curl down the loin 34 in 1931 the was officially declared a japanese national monument the mayor of odate city in prefecture organized the inu hozonkai to preserve the original as a japanese natural treasure through careful breeding 16 in 1934 the first japanese breed standard for the inu was listed following the breeds declaration as a natural monument of japan 21 in 1967 commemorating the 50th anniversary of the founding of the dog preservation society the dog museum was built to house information documents and photos 16 there is a tradition in japan that when a child is born they receive a statue of an this statue symbolizes health happiness and a long life 22 japanese history both verbal and written describe the ancestors of the the matagi dog japanese hunting dog bear hunting dog deer hunting dog 14 as one of the oldest of the native dogs today s developed primarily from dogs in the northernmost region of the island of honsh in the prefecture thus providing the breed s name 14 the matagi s quarry included wild boar sika deer and asian black bear citation needed this precursor dog tracked large game holding it at bay until hunters arrived to make the kill the breed is also influenced by crosses with larger breeds from asia and europe including english mastiffs citation needed great danes 14 st bernards 14 and the tosa inu 14 in the desire to develop a fighting dog for the burgeoning dog fighting industry in odate in the early 20th century 14 during world war ii the was also crossed with german shepherd dogs in an attempt to save them from the wartime government order for all non military dogs to be culled 14 the ancestors of the american were originally a variety of the japanese a form that was not desired in japan due to the markings and which is not eligible for show competition 12 s tend to take a socially dominant role with other dogs and thus caution must be used in situations when s are likely to be around other dogs especially unfamiliar ones citation needed in particular s tend to be less tolerant of dogs of the same sex citation needed for this reason s unless highly socialized are not generally well suited for off leash dog parks 40 the is said to be careful courageous fearless and intelligent citation needed sometimes spontaneous it needs a confident consistent handler without which the dog will be very wilful and may become very aggressive to other dogs and animals 46 american s are a low maintenance dog breed grooming them should be an easy process they are fairly heavy shedders and can go heavier than normal two to three times per year daily brushing could be a good way to reduce this problem this breed needs to bathe every few months although it can be more often depending on the needs of each owner toenails should be trimmed every month and their ears should be cleaned once a week since it is a large powerful dog the is not considered a breed for a first time dog owner citation needed the breed has been targeted by some countries breed specific legislation as a dangerous dog 41 42 43 44 the is a large strong independent and dominant dog citation needed a dog with the correct temperament should be accepting of non threatening strangers yet protective of their family when faced with a threatening situation citation needed as a breed they should be good with children it is said that the breed has an affinity for children 45 not all s will necessarily have the same temperament 46 in 1937 helen keller travelled to japan she expressed a keen interest in the breed and was presented with the first two s to enter the us 24 the first dog presented to her by mr ogasawara and named kamikaze go died at 7 1 2 months of age from distemper one month after her return to the states a second was arranged to be sent to miss keller kamikaze s litter brother kenzan go 25 kenzan go died in the mid 1940s 26 by 1939 a breed standard had been established and dog shows had been held but such activities stopped after world war ii began citation needed keller wrote in the journal during the occupation years following the war the breed began to thrive again through the efforts of sawataishi and others 23 for the first time s were bred for a standardized appearance citation needed fanciers in japan began gathering and exhibiting the remaining s and producing litters in order to restore the breed to sustainable numbers and to accentuate the original characteristics of the breed muddied by crosses to other breeds 30 u s servicemen fell in love with the and imported many with them upon their return the is a powerful independent and dominant breed commonly aloof with strangers but affectionate with family members as a breed s are generally hardy but they have been known to suffer from various genetic conditions and be sensitive to certain drugs recognized by the american kennel club in 1955 it was placed in the miscellaneous class citation needed it was not until the end of 1972 that the akc approved the standard and it was moved to the working dog class as such the is a rather new breed in the united states citation needed foundation stock in america continued to be imported from japan until 1974 when the akc cut off registration to any further japanese imports until 1992 when it recognized the japan kennel club citation needed the decision by the akc to disallow the registration of any further imported dogs in 1974 set the stage for the divergence in type between the american and japanese inu that is present today citation needed in most countries the american strain of is now considered a separate breed in the united states and canada however the two strains are considered a single breed with differences in type for a while the american strain of was known in some countries as the great japanese dog both forms of are probably best known worldwide from the true story of hachik a loyal who lived in japan before world war ii elsewhere in the world the american was first introduced to the uk in 1937 he was a canadian import owned by a mrs jenson however the breed was not widely known until the early 1980s 26 the breed was introduced in australia in 1982 with an american import and to new zealand in 1986 with an import from the u k 26 breed standards state that all dog breed coat colors are allowable in the american including pinto all types of brindle solid white black mask white mask self colored mask even differing colors of under coat and overlay guard hairs 36 this includes the common shiba inu coloring pattern known as urajiro citation needed the japanese s as per the breed standards are restricted to red fawn sesame brindle pure white all with urajiro markings i e whitish coat on the sides of the muzzle on the cheeks on the underside of jaw neck chest body and tail and on the inside of the legs 7 the is generally seen as territorial about its property and can be reserved with strangers citation needed it is sometimes described as feline in its actions it is not unusual for an to clean its face after eating to preen its kennel mate and to be fastidious in the house 40 they are known to be intolerant of other dogs of the same sex as stated in the akc breed standard 4 just as the breed was stabilizing in its native land world war ii pushed the to the brink of extinction early in the war the dogs suffered from lack of nutritious food then many were killed to be eaten by the starving populace and their pelts were used as clothing finally the government ordered all remaining dogs to be killed on sight to prevent the spread of disease the only way concerned owners could save their beloved s was to turn them loose in remote mountain areas where they bred back with their ancestor dogs the matagi 14 or conceal them from authorities by means of crossing with german shepherd dogs and naming them in the style of german shepherd dogs of the time 14 morie sawataishi and his efforts to breed the is a major reason this breed exists today 29 mature american type males measure typically 2628 inches 6671 cm at the withers and weigh between 100130 lb 4559 kg citation needed mature females typically measure 2426 inches 6166 cm and weigh between 70100 lb 3245 kg 35 the japanese type as stated in the breed standards are a little smaller and lighter citation needed
American_Bulldog,the is a stocky well built strong looking dog with a large head and a muscular build its coat is short and generally smooth the breed is a light to moderate shedder colors while historically predominantly white with patches of red black or brindle have grown in recent years to include many color patterns including black red brown fawn and all shades of brindle the color conformation is quite varied but solid black or any degree of merle is considered a cosmetic fault and a blue color is a disqualification by the nkc breed standard 1 black pigmentation on the nose and eye rims is traditionally preferred with only some pink allowed eye color is usually brown but heterochromia also occurs although this is also considered a cosmetic fault s are known to drool more than other breeds of dog this varies and is more prevalent in the bully type which is generally a larger heavier dog with a shorter muzzle standard or performance types are generally more athletic with longer muzzles and a more square head it is important to note that many modern s are a combination of the two types usually termed hybrid in general s weigh between 27 and 54 kg 60 to 120 lb and are 52 to 70 cm 20 to 28 in at the withers but have been known to greatly exceed these dimensions especially in the out of standard nonworking stock the is a breed of utility dog there are two specific types of standard and classic additionally there are also mixes of the two types s generally live from 10 to 16 years and tend to be strong physically active and often healthy some health problems in s are often found within certain genetic lines and are not common to the entire breed while others such as neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis ncl 2 ichthyosis disorders of the kidney and thyroid acl tears hip dysplasia cherry eye elbow dysplasia entropion ectropion and bone cancer are more common to the general population of s there are dna tests available to help breeders screen breeding animals for ncl neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis 2 and ichthyosis a penn hip pennsylvania hip improvement project or ofa orthopedic foundation for animals screening is recommended for all potential breeding animals some s are prone to allergies symptoms like a runny nose or a rash are examples of signs of allergies some vets recommend dog owners to give 25 mg of benadryl per day in most cases it helps citation needed even the slight modifications the underwent in spain and england up to the industrial revolution before 1835 were absent in the working strains most settlers of the south came from the west midlands of england and emigrated as a result of the civil war between royalists and parliamentarians prior to the industrial revolution the old english was preserved by working class immigrants who brought their working dogs with them to the south small farmers and ranchers used this all around working dog for many tasks including farm guardians stock dogs and catch dog these dogs were not an actual breed as considered by today s standards but were a generic type there were no recorded pedigrees or records and breeding decisions were dependent on the best working farm dogs despite breed or background several separate strains of the type dogs were kept by ranchers as utilitarian working dogs perhaps the most important role of the and the reason for its survival and in fact why it thrived throughout the south was because of the presence of feral pigs introduced to the new world and without predators the s were the settlers only means of sufficiently dealing with the vermin by world war ii the breed was near extinction until john d johnson and his father scoured the back roads of the south looking for the best specimens to revive the breed during this time a young alan scott grew an interest in johnson s dogs and began to work with him on the revitalization process at some point alan scott began infusing non johnson catch s from working southern farms with john d johnson s line creating the now standard at another point johnson began crossing his line with an atavistic english from the north that had maintained its genetic athletic vigor s are now safe from extinction and are enjoying a healthy increase in popularity either as a working protector dog or as a family pet all over the world they are used variously as hog dogs catching escaped pigs or hunting razorbacks as cattle drovers and as working or sport k 9s s also successfully compete in several dog sports such as dog obedience schutzhund french ring mondio ring iron dog competition and weight pulling they are also exhibited in conformation shows in the ukc nkc aba abra ekc and the sacbr s are typically confident social and active dogs that are at ease with their families it is not uncommon for an to require a high level of attention due to their highly emotional personality they bond strongly with their owners they are capable of jumping in excess of 3 feet 0 91 m vertical due to the dense muscle build of the breed young s may be slightly aloof with strangers but as they mature the breed s normal confidence should assert itself this breed tolerates children and can do very well with them provided they are socialized early and understand their limits the more exposure to good training practices other dogs and people the more likely the success at being controlled both inside and outside of their environment early training and socialization both in the home and outside of the home is essential for this breed while the goal of the breed was originally to produce a working farm utility dog that could catch and hold wild boar and cattle kill vermin and guard an owner s property when properly trained exercised and socialized this breed can become a family pet citation needed
Australian_Shepherd,the has a reputation as a highly intelligent and versatile stock dog with a range of working styles 15 a good working aussie is quick thoughtful and easy with its stock the ability for the breed to adapt to the situation and to think for itself makes it an excellent all around worker for this reason the aussie is often chosen to work unusual livestock such as ducks geese and commercially raised rabbits the breed is typically highly energetic requiring a great deal of exercise and attention 8 an enjoys working whether it is learning and practicing tricks competing in dog agility or engaging in any other physically and mentally involving activity 13 there are different theories regarding the association of the breed with australia but there is no consensus on why it was adopted 5 genetic research has found that s and border collies are closely related to each other both are slightly more distantly related to other kinds of collies and to shetland sheepdogs 6 some aussies are born with naturally bobbed tails others have full long tails and others with natural partial bobs where the tail is shorter and appears stubby breeders have historically docked the tails when the puppies are born in the united states and canada the standard calls for a natural bob or docked tail not to exceed four inches as a defining characteristic however some long tailed examples have been successfully shown and been given recognition any natural tail length is permitted when showing in europe where docking has been banned in most countries including the united kingdom the median lifespans for breeds similar in size to s are mostly between 11 and 13 years 20 so assuming the results of the uk study are not representative of the population there aussies appear to have a typical lifespan for a breed their size leading causes of death in the uk survey were cancer 32 combinations 18 and old age 14 aussie colors are black red sometimes called liver blue merle marbled black white and gray and red merle marbled red white and buff 8 each of these colors may also have copper tan points or white markings in various combinations on the face chest and legs a black or red dog with copper and white trim is called tricolor or tri a black or red dog with white trim but no copper is called bicolor or bi white rather than pigment on or around the ears is an indicator of increased risk for white related deafness excessive white on the face and ears can place an individual dog at greater risk for sunburn and subsequent skin cancer s have a medium length water resistant coat with the coat being somewhat long and wavy or curly this breed does shed mostly in the spring to get rid of the winter coat the should be brushed weekly to maintain a healthy and clean coat and also to prevent matting with being a working dog this breed should be outside to get its needed exercise if a dog is dirty a basic bath can be given but not frequently for it can dry out the skin and coat 19 the wide variety of color combinations comes from the interaction between the a color allele which is either black b dominant or red b recessive and the dominant merle allele m together these provide four coat color aspects that can appear in any combination 10 the is a medium sized breed of solid build they can weigh from 30 to 65 pounds 14 to 29 kg and stand from 17 to 26 inches 43 to 66 cm in height the club of america asca standard calls for the to stand between 18 and 23 inches 46 and 58 cm at the withers females being 18 to 21 inches 46 to 53 cm and males measuring 20 to 23 inches 51 to 58 cm however quality is not to be sacrificed in favor of size 1 also great variety is seen in the aussie s eye color and they are often heterochromatic an early nickname for the breed was ghost eye dog aussie eyes may be any shade of brown or blue they may have two differently colored eyes or even have bicolored or split eyes for example a half brown half blue eye which appear to be linked to the merle coloration merled eyes occur as well where one color is mixed in and swirled with another any combination of eye color is acceptable in the breed standard so long as the eyes are healthy in general however black aussies self bi color or tri color tend to have brown eyes while red self bi color or tri color aussies tend to have amber eyes though these aussies may also carry the blue eyed gene these dogs are also brown in color dogs may show reserved and cautious guarding behaviors they are kind loving and devoted to those they know they are very loyal to their owners and are rewarding dogs if treated well 13 because the breed was developed to serve on the ranch a job which includes being protective of its property it is inclined to bark warnings about neighborhood activity it is not inclined toward obsessive barking these dogs require a minimum of two to three hours a day of play exercise and attention they thrive in rural ranch like conditions and need space to run and play in an urban setting the is a high spirited dog that requires much attention and work teaching them tricks keeps them focused and happy which also keeps their minds working the breed also has great stamina and can live in a variety of terrain because of this they are popularly used as trail and working dogs 14 all black and blue merle dogs have black noses eye rims and lips all red and red merle dogs have liver or brown noses eye rims and lips the merle allele which produces a mingled or patchwork combination of dark and light areas is the coat pattern most commonly associated with the breed this merle m is dominant so heterozygous dogs mm show the pigmentation pattern however when two merles are bred the statistical risk is 25 of the offspring will end up with the two copies of the merle gene homozygous these dogs usually have a mostly white coat and blue irises and are often deaf blind or both in this case the deafness and blindness are linked to having two copies of the merle gene which disrupts pigmentation and produces these health defects 12 1315 the aussie is intelligent learns quickly and loves to play 14 this means that a bored neglected unexercised aussie may invent its own games activities and jobs which to a busy owner might appear to be hyperactivity for example an aussie may go from being at rest to running at top speed for several laps around the house before returning to rest without something to amuse them aussies can become destructive aussies also do best with plenty of human companionship they are often called velcro dogs for their strong desire to always be near their owners and for their tendency to form intense devoted bonds with select people 13 the recommended amount of food an should eat is 1 1 2 to 2 cups of dry food a day 18 but size exercise level and age should be considered with proper diet and exercise the can stay in good shape 18 can have several health problems vision problems are common and 16 epilepsy is also a concern in merle to merle breeding the puppies that have inherited two copies of the merle gene have an increased risk of being born blind and or deaf 17 the often known simply as the aussie is a medium sized breed of dog that was despite its name developed on ranches in the western united states during the 19th century 2 3 4 s rose in popularity with a boom in western riding why after world war ii 7 they became known to the general public through rodeos horse shows and disney movies made for television for many years aussies have been valued by stockmen for their versatility and trainability they have a similar look to the popular english and border collie breeds while they continue to work as stock dogs and compete in herding trials the breed has earned recognition in other roles due to their trainability and eagerness to please and are highly regarded for their skills in obedience 8 like all working breeds the aussie has considerable energy and drive and usually needs a job to do it often excels at dog sports such as dog agility and frisbee they are also highly successful search and rescue dogs disaster dogs detection dogs guide dogs service dogs and therapy dogs they are considered the 17th most popular dog breed in the united states 9
Basset_Hound,in this article with a capital b is used to distinguish the modern breed from other type dogs s are large short solid and long with curved sabre tails held high over their long backs an adult dog weighs between 20 and 35 kilograms 44 and 77 lb this breed relative to size is heavier boned than any other 2 the is a short legged breed of dog of the family as well as one of six recognized breeds in france the is a scent that was originally bred for the purpose of hunting hare their sense of smell for tracking is second only to that of the blood 1 the name is derived from the french word bas meaning low with the attenuating suffix et meaning small together meaning rather low s are usually bicolours or tricolours of standard colouration puppy many s have a clearly defined white blaze and a white tip to their tail intended to aid hunters in finding their dogs when tracking through underbrush according to the club of america the height of a should not exceed 14 inches or 36 cm 9 the em allele produces a black mask on the face that may extend up around the eyes and onto the ears this pattern is most easily seen on mahogany dogs although any colour pattern may express the em allele except for red and white or lemon and white due to e e 4 an adult with a puppy the source of colour is the e locus mc1r which has four alleles em eg e and e the em e and e alleles are present in the s the e allele allows for the production of both red and black pigments so is present with the majority of colour patterns in s the coat is naturally oily giving off a distinctive scent which is natural to the breed 5 the coat of a is medium short smooth and hard and sheds frequently any true colour is acceptable in s and no one colour is preferred over any other 3 s have large pendulous ears 7 known as leathers that do not allow air to circulate inside them unlike other breeds with erect or more open ears this can result in infections and ear mites if their ears are not kept clean and dry 8 the is a friendly outgoing and playful dog tolerant of children and other pets 6 two s red and lemon colours are caused by the e allele of mc1r the e allele is recessive so red and lemon dogs are homozygous e e lemon dogs are lighter in colour than reds but the genetic mechanism that dilutes phaeomelanin in this instance is unknown no black hairs will be present on either red or lemon dogs if there are any black hairs the dog is officially a tricolour this breed like its ancestor the blood has a hanging skin structure which causes the face to occasionally look sad this for many people adds to the breed s charm the dewlap seen as the loose elastic skin around the neck and the trailing ears which along with the blood are the longest of any breed help trap the scent of what they are tracking its neck is wider than its head this combined with the loose skin around its face and neck means that flat collars can easily be pulled off the looseness of the skin results in the s characteristic facial wrinkles the s skull is characterised by its large dolichocephalic nose which is second only to the blood in scenting ability and number of olfactory receptor cells
Beagle,from medieval times was used as a generic description for the smaller hounds though these dogs differed considerably from the modern breed miniature breeds of type dogs were known from the times of edward ii and henry vii who both had packs of glove s so named since they were small enough to fit on a glove and queen elizabeth i kept a breed known as a pocket which stood 8 to 9 inches 20 to 23 cm at the shoulder small enough to fit in a pocket or saddlebag they rode along on the hunt the larger hounds would run the prey to ground then the hunters would release the small dogs to continue the chase through underbrush elizabeth i referred to the dogs as her singing s and often entertained guests at her royal table by letting her pocket s cavort amid their plates and cups 6 19th century sources refer to these breeds interchangeably and it is possible that the two names refer to the same small variety in george jesse s researches into the history of the british dog from 1866 the early 17th century poet and writer gervase markham is quoted referring to the as small enough to sit on a man s hand and to the by the 18th century two breeds had been developed for hunting hare and rabbit the southern hound and the north country or northern hound the southern hound a tall heavy dog with a square head and long soft ears was common from south of the river trent and probably closely related to the talbot hound though slow it had stamina and an excellent scenting ability the north country possibly a cross between an offshoot of the talbot stock and a greyhound was bred chiefly in yorkshire and was common in the northern counties it was smaller than the southern hound less heavy set and with a more pointed muzzle it was faster than its southern counterpart but its scenting abilities were less well developed 9 as fox hunting became increasingly popular numbers of both types of hound diminished the type dogs were crossed with larger breeds such as stag hounds to produce the modern foxhound the size varieties came close to extinction but some farmers in the south ensured the survival of the prototype breeds by maintaining small rabbit hunting packs it is not known why the black and tan kerry present in ireland since celtic times has the description since at 22 to 24 inches 56 to 61 cm it is significantly taller than the modern day and in earlier times was even larger some writers suggest that the s scenting ability may have come from cross breeding earlier strains with the kerry originally used for hunting stags it is today used for hare and drag hunting 28 reverend phillip honeywood established a pack in essex in the 1830s and it is believed that this pack formed the basis for the modern breed although details of the pack s lineage are not recorded it is thought that north country s and southern hounds were strongly represented william youatt suspected that harriers formed a good majority of the s bloodline but the origin of the harrier is itself obscure 10 honeywood s s were small standing at about 10 inches 25 cm at the shoulder and pure white according to john mills writing in the sportsman s library in 1845 prince albert and lord winterton also had packs around this time and royal favour no doubt led to some revival of interest in the breed but honeywood s pack was regarded as the finest of the three 11 by 1887 the threat of extinction was on the wane there were 18 packs in england 15 the club was formed in 1890 and the first standard drawn up at the same time 16 the following year the association of masters of harriers and s was formed both organisations aimed to further the best interests of the breed and both were keen to produce a standard type of 17 by 1902 the number of packs had risen to 44 15 although type dogs have existed for 2 500 years the modern breed was developed in great britain around the 1830s from several breeds including the talbot hound the north country the southern hound and possibly the harrier s have been depicted in popular culture since elizabethan times in literature and paintings and more recently in film television and comic books snoopy of the comic strip peanuts has been promoted as the world s most famous 1 they have a smooth somewhat domed skull with a medium length square cut muzzle and a black or occasionally liver gumdrop nose the jaw is strong and the teeth scissor together with the upper teeth fitting perfectly over the lower teeth and both sets aligned square to the jaw the eyes are large hazel or brown with a mild hound like pleading look the large ears are long soft and low set turning towards the cheeks slightly and rounded at the tips s have a strong medium length neck which is long enough for them to easily bend to the ground to pick up a scent with little folding in the skin but some evidence of a dewlap a broad chest narrowing to a tapered abdomen and waist and a long slightly curved tail known as the stern tipped with white the white tip known as the flag has been selectively bred for as it allows the dog to be easily seen when its head is down following a scent 31 the tail does not curl over the back but is held upright when the dog is active the has a muscular body and a medium length smooth hard coat the front legs are straight and carried under the body while the rear legs are muscular and well bent at the stifles 32 in the 1840s a standard type was beginning to develop the distinction between the north country and southern hound had been lost but there was still a large variation in size character and reliability among the emerging packs 13 in 1856 stonehenge the pseudonym of john henry walsh writing in the manual of british rural sports was still dividing s into four varieties the medium the dwarf or lapdog the fox a smaller slower version of the foxhound and the rough coated or terrier which he classified as a cross between any of the other varieties and one of the scottish terrier breeds 14 stonehenge also gives the start of a standard description the is a breed of small hound similar in appearance to the much larger foxhound the is a scent hound developed primarily for hunting hare with a great sense of smell and their tracking instinct the is employed as detection dog for prohibited agricultural imports and foodstuffs in quarantine around the world the is intelligent but single minded it is a popular pet due to its size good temper and lack of inherited health problems in size the measures from 10 inches or even less to 15 in shape they resemble the old southern hound in miniature but with more neatness and beauty and they also resemble that hound in style of hunting 14 as purebred dogs s have always been more popular in the united states and canada than in their native country england the national club of america was formed in 1888 and by 1901 a had won a best in show title as in the uk activity during world war i was minimal but the breed showed a much stronger revival in the u s when hostilities ceased in 1928 it won a number of prizes at the westminster kennel club s show and by 1939 a  champion meadowlark draughtsman  had captured the title of

registered breeds 23 in 2005 and 2006 it ranked 5th out of the 155 breeds registered 24 in the uk they are not quite so popular placing 28th and 30th in the rankings of registrations with the kennel club in 2005 and 2006 respectively 25 in the united states the ranked 4th most popular breed in 2012 and 2013 behind the labrador retriever 1 german shepherd 2 and golden retriever 3 breeds 26 in the 11th century william the conqueror brought the talbot hound to britain the talbot was a predominantly white slow deep throated scent hound derived from the st hubert hound which had been developed in the 8th century at some point the english talbots were crossed with greyhounds to give them an extra turn of speed 5 long extinct the talbot strain probably gave rise to the southern hound which in turn is thought to be an ancestor of the modern day b according to the oxford english dictionary the first mention of the by name in english literature dates from c 1475 in the squire of low degree the origin of the word is uncertain although it has been suggested that the word derives from the french begueule 27 on its formation the association of masters of harriers and s took over the running of a regular show at peterborough that had started in 1889 and the club in the uk held its first show in 1896 16 the regular showing of the breed led to the development of a uniform type and the continued to prove a success up until the outbreak of world war i when all shows were suspended after the war the breed was again struggling for survival in the uk the last of the pocket s was probably lost during this time and registrations fell to an all time low a few breeders notably reynalton kennels managed to revive interest in the dog and by world war ii the breed was once again doing well registrations dropped again after the end of the war but almost immediately recovered 20 dogs of similar size and purpose to the modern a can be traced in ancient greece 2 back to around the 5th century bc xenophon born around 430 bc in his treatise on hunting or cynegeticus refers to a hound that hunted hares by scent and was followed on foot small hounds are mentioned in the forest laws of canute which exempted them from the ordinance which commanded that all dogs capable of running down a stag should have one foot mutilated 3 if genuine these laws would confirm that type dogs were present in england before 1016 but it is likely the laws were written in the middle ages to give a sense of antiquity and tradition to forest law 4 the general appearance of the resembles a miniature foxhound but the head is broader and the muzzle shorter the expression completely different and the legs shorter in proportion to the body 29 they are generally between 13 and 16 inches 33 and 41 cm high at the withers and weigh between 18 and 35 lb 8 2 and 15 9 kg with females being slightly smaller than males on average 30 little small mitten which may be companion for a ladies kirtle and in the field will run as cunningly as any hound whatere only their musick is very small like reeds 7 although credited with the development of the modern breed honeywood concentrated on producing dogs for hunting and it was left to thomas johnson to refine the breeding to produce dogs that were both attractive and capable hunters two strains were developed the rough and smooth coated varieties the rough coated survived until the beginning of the 20th century and there were even records of one making an appearance at a dog show as late as 1969 but this variety is now extinct having probably been absorbed into the standard bloodline 12 s were in the united states by the 1840s at the latest but the first dogs were imported strictly for hunting and were of variable quality since honeywood had only started breeding in the 1830s it is unlikely these dogs were representative of the modern breed and the description of them as looking like straight legged dachshunds with weak heads has little resemblance to the standard serious attempts at establishing a quality bloodline began in the early 1870s when general richard rowett from illinois imported some dogs from england and began breeding rowett s s are believed to have formed the models for the first american standard drawn up by rowett l h twadell and norman ellmore in 1887 18 the was accepted as a breed by the american kennel club akc in 1885 19 in the 20th century the breed has spread worldwide standards for the pocket were drawn up as late as 1901 these genetic lines are now extinct although modern breeders have attempted to recreate the variety 8

four breeds of sennenhund type s from the swiss alps the name sennenhund is derived from the german senne alpine pasture and hund  as they accompanied the alpine herders and dairymen called senn berner or in english refers to the area of the breeds origin in the canton of bern this was originally kept as a general farm large sennenhunde in the past were also used as draft animals pulling carts the breed was officially established in 1907 3 in 1937 the american kennel club recognized it 4 today the club classifies it as a member of the working group 5 the is slightly longer than it is tall and it is highly muscular the breed was used as an all purpose farm for guarding property and to drive dairy cattle long distances from the farm to the alpine pastures the type was originally called the dürrbächler for a small town dürrbach where the large s were especially frequent 15 in the early 1900s fanciers exhibited the few examples of the large s at shows in berne and in 1907 a few breeders from the burgdorf region founded the first breed club the schweizerische dürrbach klub and wrote the first standard which defined the s as a separate breed by 1910 there were already 107 registered members of the breed there is a photo of a working dated 1905 at the fumee fall rest area in quinnesec mi like the other sennenhunde the is a large heavy with a distinctive tri colored coat black with white chest and rust colored markings above eyes sides of mouth front of legs and a small amount around the white chest an ideal of a perfectly marked individual gives the impression of a white horseshoe shape around the nose and a white swiss cross on the chest when viewed from the front a swiss kiss is a white mark located typically behind the neck but may be a part of the neck a full ring would not meet type standard the akc breed standard lists as disqualifications blue eye color and any ground color other than black 6 7 special attention should be paid to the ears of the as they can trap bacteria dirt and liquid 30 the risk of an ear infection drops with weekly ear cleanings using a veterinarian recommended cleanser 30 the s calm temperament makes them a natural for pulling small carts or wagons a task they originally performed in switzerland with proper training they enjoy giving children rides in a cart or participating in a parade such as the conway new hampshire holiday parade 27 regional clubs often offer carting workshops 28 carting competitions are held for the breed b the four breeds of sennenhund with the original breed name followed by the most popular english version of the breed name s shed year round and the heaviest shedding is during seasonal changes 30 usually the will only require a brushing once a week with more in spring and fall to keep its coat neat and reduce the amount of fur on the floor and furniture 30 the will only require a bath about once every couple of months or so depending on how high its activity level is and how often it spends its time in the dirt 30 these s are very popular as family s in german speaking countries where they are among the most popular breeds for example the german association of

in the roman molosser breeds 13 14 a work well with other pets and around strangers 9 they are excellent guardians they tend to bond with one owner and are somewhat aloof and standoffish 11 cancer is the leading cause of death for s in general but s have a much higher rate of fatal cancer than other breeds in both u s canada and uk surveys nearly half of s die of cancer 18 19 compared to about 27 of all s 18 s are killed by many types of cancer including malignant histiocytosis mast cell tumor lymphosarcoma fibrosarcoma and osteosarcoma 19 inherited medical problems that a may face include malignant histiocytosis hypomyelinogenesis progressive retinal atrophy and possibly cataracts and hypoadrenocorticism 20 the breed is also prone to histiocytic sarcoma a cancer of the muscle tissue

to musculoskeletal causes arthritis hip dysplasia and cruciate ligament rupture were reported as the cause of death in 6 of s in the uk study 18 for comparison mortality due to musculoskeletal ailments was reported to be less than 2 for pure bred s in general owners of s are nearly three times as likely as owners of other breeds to report musculoskeletal problems in their s 18 the most commonly reported being cruciate ligament rupture arthritis especially in shoulders and elbows hip dysplasia and osteochondritis 18 19 the age at onset for musculoskeletal problems is also unusually low in the u s canada study 11 of living s had arthritis at an average age of 4 3 years 19 most other common non musculoskeletal morbidity issues strike berners at rates similar to other breeds 18 prospective owners should be prepared to cope with a large that may have mobility problems at a young age options to help mobility impaired s may include ramps for car or house access lifting harnesses and slings and wheelchairs ex walkin` wheels comfortable bedding may help alleviate joint pain the breed standard for the states that s should not be aggressive anxious or distinctly shy but rather should be good natured self assured placid towards strangers and docile 7 the temperament of individual s may vary and not all examples of the breed have been bred carefully to follow the standard all large breed s should be well socialized when they are puppies and given regular training and activities throughout their lives

however it gained a cult following in subsequent years ownership especially in the eastern states climbed dramatically though not considered a retriever or water dog the due to its ancestry as a sailor s dog has an affinity for and enjoys water and retrieving on the boats however the dog s job was that of a companion dog the is often depicted as a french dog although the breed is originally spanish used as sailing dogs but when the french took over this gentle breed became a lap dog species the s were divided into four categories the maltese the bolognaise the havanese and the tenerife this breed all originated in the mediterranean area 9 because of their merry disposition they traveled much and were often used as barter by sailors as they moved from continent to continent the dogs found early success in spain and it is generally believed that spanish seamen introduced the breed to the canary island of tenerife in the 14th century italian sailors rediscovered the little dogs on their voyages and are credited with returning them to the continent where they became great favorites of italian nobility often as was the style of the day with dogs in the courts they were cut lion

interest in the breed was renewed during the rule of napoleon iii but then waned until the late 19th century when it became the common dog running the streets accompanying the organ grinders of barbary leading the blind and doing tricks in circuses and fairs on 5 march 1933 the official standard of the breed was adopted by the société centrale canine the national kennel club for france 10 this was largely due to the success of the french speaking belgian author hergé s the adventures of tintin which featured a small fluffy white fox terrier dog named milou snowy in the english editions as the breed was known by two names at that time tenerife and the president of the fédération cynologique internationale proposed a name based on the characteristics that the dogs presented  the

Border_Collie,it is unclear whether hindhope jed was a descendant of old hemp born two years after him she is mentioned in a british hunts and huntsmen article concerning a mr john elliot of jedburgh 27 two types of hearing loss occur in the breed the first type is pigment associated and is found in puppies although the puppies can have congenital sensorineural deafness from birth as well 14 the second type is known as adult onset hearing loss these dogs have a normal auditory brainstem response test as pups but gradually lose their hearing some time between one and eight years of age a study is currently underway at the translational genomics research institute to identify the genetic cause of adult onset hearing loss in the breed the is descended from landrace s a type found widely in the british isles the name for the breed came from its probable place of origin along the anglo scottish 2 mention of the or colley type first appeared toward the end of the 19th century although the word is older than this and has its origin in the scots language it is also thought that the word comes from the old celtic word for useful many of the best s today can be traced back to a dog known as old hemp 19 leading causes of death are cancer 23 6 old age 17 9 and cerebral vascular afflictions 9 4 9 in 1915 james reid secretary of the international sheep dog society isds in the united kingdom first used the term to distinguish those dogs registered by the isds from the kennel club s or scotch including the rough and smooth which originally came from the same working stock but had developed a different standardised appearance following introduction to the show ring in 1860 and mixture with different types breeds 20 dogs bred for show are more homogeneous in appearance than working s since to win in conformation showing they must conform closely to breed club standards that are specific on many points of the structure coat and colour kennel clubs specify for example that the must have a keen and intelligent expression and that the preferred eye colour is dark brown in deference to the dog s working origin scars and broken teeth received in the line of duty are not to

treatment or cure but a dna test is now available to detect carriers as well as affected dogs the is a working and herding dog breed developed in the anglo scottish region for herding livestock especially sheep it was specifically bred for intelligence and obedience at the time of her departure to new zealand hindhope jed was already in pup to captain another of the then new strain hindhope jed had won three trials in her native scotland and was considered to be the best to cross the equator 29 s were listed as imports to new zealand as early as 1858 but the type was not specified 24 in the late 1890s james lilico 25 1861 1945 of christchurch new zealand imported a number of working dogs from the united kingdom these included hindhope jed a black tan and white 26 born in hindhope scotland in 1895 as well as maudie moss of ancrum ness and old bob in nearly every region of the world the is now also a breed which is shown in ring or bench shows for the people who participate in these events the is defined by the breed standard which is a description of how the dog should look in new zealand and australia where the breed has been shown throughout most of the twentieth century the standards have produced a dog with the longer double coat smooth coats are allowed a soft dark eye a body slightly longer than tall a well defined stop semi pricked ears as well as a gentle and friendly temperament this style of has become popular in winning show kennels around the world as well as among prestigious judges breed standards state that its tail must be slightly curved and must stop at the hock the fur must be lush it should show good expression in its eyes and must be intelligent it is energetic with most commonly a black and white coat sometimes brown it should have a very strong herding instinct in general s are medium sized dogs with a moderate amount of coat which is most often thick and sheds often they have a double coat which varies from smooth to rough and is occasionally curled whilst black and white is most commonly seen colour pattern of the the breed appears in just about any colour and pattern known to occur in dogs some of these include black tricolour black tan white liver and white and red tricolour red tan white have also been seen regularly with other colours such as blue lilac red merle blue merle brindle and australian red also known as ee red blonde recessive red or gold which is seen less frequently some s may also have single colour coats 2 s require considerably more daily physical exercise and mental stimulation than many other breeds 5 the is an intelligent dog breed 1 6 in fact it is widely considered to be the most intelligent dog breed although the primary role of the is to herd livestock this breed is becoming increasingly popular as a companion animal hip dysplasia eye anomaly cea and epilepsy are considered the primary genetic diseases of concern in the breed at this time 11 cea is a congenital inherited eye disease involving the retina choroid and sclera that sometimes affects s in s it is generally a mild disease and rarely significantly impairs vision however other eye conditions such as pra 12 slowly disintegrates the retina and can cause s to lose almost all of their vision at night which can progress into complete daytime blindness there is now a dna test available for cea 13 and through its use breeders can ensure that they will not produce affected pups there are different types of hip testing available including ofa orthopedic foundation for animals and pennhip radiographs are taken and sent to these organizations to determine a dog s hip and elbow quality the natural life span of the is between 10 and 14 years with an average lifespan of 12 years 9 the median longevities of breeds of similar size are usually 12 to 13 years 10 eye colour varies from brown to blue and occasionally eyes of differing colour occur this is usually seen with merles the ears of the are also variable  some have fully erect ears some fully dropped ears and others semi erect ears similar to those of the rough although working handlers sometimes have superstitions about the appearance of their dogs handlers may avoid mostly white dogs due to the unfounded idea that sheep will not respect a white or almost all white dog 3 in general a dog s appearance is considered by the american association to be irrelevant 4 it is considered much more useful to identify a working by its attitude and ability than by its looks mr elliot himself is well known for his breed of s his father supplied noble to the late queen victoria and it was from our subject that the mcleod got hindhope jed now the champion of new zealand and australia 28 in 1901 the king and mcleod stud created by charles beechworth king b 1855 murrumbidgee nsw his brother and alec mcleod at canonbar near nyngan north west of sydney brought hindhope jed to australia where she enjoyed considerable success at sheep dog trials in this role due to their working heritage s are very demanding playful and energetic they thrive best in households that can provide them with plenty of play and exercise either with humans or other dogs 5 due to their demanding personalities and need for mental stimulation and exercise many s develop problematic behaviours in households that are not able to provide for their needs 7 they are infamous for chewing holes in walls furniture such as chairs and table legs destructive scraping and hole digging due to boredom s may exhibit a strong desire to herd a trait they may show with small children cats and other dogs the breed s herding trait has been deliberately encouraged as it was in the dogs from which the was developed by selective breeding for many generations 5 however being eminently trainable they can live amicably with other pets if given proper socialisation training the original test is the isds sheepdog trial it is still used today where a dog and handler collect groups of livestock and move them quietly around a course there are certain standard elements to this test depending on the level national or international for both levels sheep must be gathered as calmly as possible without being distressed 30 for a national competition normally held between england ireland scotland and wales trials run over a 400 yard course 31 international courses use a 400 yard course for the qualifying trials but on the third and final day trials are held in a course of 800 yards 31 the international test involves a double fetch where the sheepdog must gather 10 sheep from 800 yards away bring them on an angle to the center of the field and then be sent back in another direction to gather another 10 sheep also placed 800 yards from the handler five of those 20 sheep will have collars on and at the end of a triangular drive the sheep are gathered into a circular shedding ring and the 15 sheep without collars driven away as the five collared sheep are kept inside the ring and then penned 30 32 sheepdogs must be directed through obstacles at varying distance from the handler and then the dog must demonstrate the ability to do work close at hand by penning the sheep and sorting them out 33 trapped neutrophil syndrome tns is a hereditary disease in which the bone marrow produces neutrophils white cells but is unable to effectively release them into the bloodstream affected puppies have an impaired immune system and will eventually die from infections they cannot fight the mutation responsible for tns has been found in s in english working dogs in show dogs that had originated in australia and new zealand and in unrelated australian working dogs this indicates that the gene is widespread and probably as old as the breed itself tns was identified by jeremy shearman in the laboratory of dr alan wilton of the school of biotechnology and biomolecular sciences university of new south wales there is no cure but a dna test is now available to detect carriers as well as affected dogs 16 17 there are two types of tests or standards to determine the breeding quality of a the original isds sheepdog trial and appearance old hemp a

the subject of further investigation 18 elbow dysplasia may also occur in the breed dogs homozygous for the merle gene sometimes referred to as double merles are likely to have ocular and or auditory defects before taking on the breed as a household pet potential owners should be sure they can provide regular exercise commensurate with the s high energy and prodigious stamina a working may run many miles a day using its experience personality and intelligence to control challenging livestock and these dogs will be distressed and frustrated if left in isolation ignored or inactive like many working breeds s can be motion sensitive and may chase moving vehicles and bicycles but this behaviour can be modified by training 8 some of the more difficult behaviours require patience as they are developmental and may disappear as the dog matures

brachycephalic they have broad short skulls have a square muzzle mandibular prognathism an underbite very strong jaws and a powerful bite ideal for hanging on to large prey the was bred from the old english bulldog and the now extinct bullenbeisser which became extinct by crossbreeding rather than by a decadence of the breed the purpose of the crossbreeding was the wish to eliminate the excessive white color of the breed and the necessity of producing thousands of dogs for one of the most popular breeds in the world the is part of the molosser group this group is a category of solidly built large dog breeds that all descend from the same common ancestor the large shepherd dog known as a molossus the is a member of the working group 4 white the first club was founded in 1895 with s being first exhibited in a dog show for st bernards in munich the next year based on 2013 american kennel club statistics s held steady as the seventh most popular breed of dog in the united states for the fourth consecutive year 5 however according to 6 the akc s website the is now the eighth most popular dog breed in the united states the does not carry the gene for a solid black coat color and therefore purebred black s do not exist 11 in the past breeders often euthanized white puppies at birth a 1998 study of s in the netherlands showed that 17 of pups were euthanized because they were white 16 previously the american club unofficially recommended euthanasia for these animals 17 reasons for euthanizing white pups includes the view that it is unethical to sell a dog with faults and the perception that white s are at higher risk of ending up abandoned in rescues 18 today breeders are increasingly reluctant to euthanize healthy pups 17 and may choose to neuter and place them in pet homes instead the colour brindle can be with or without white markings the is a short haired breed with a shiny smooth coat that lies tight to the body the recognized colors are fawn and brindle 4 frequently with a white underbelly and white on the feet these white markings called flash often extend onto the neck or face and dogs that have these markings are known as flashy fawn denotes a range of color the tones of which may be described variously as light tan or yellow reddish tan mahogany or stag deer red and dark honey blonde in the uk and europe fawn s are typically rich in color and are often called red brindle refers to a dog with black stripes on a fawn background some brindle s are so heavily striped that they give the appearance of reverse brindling fawn stripes on a black body these dogs are conventionally called reverse brindles but that is actually a misnomerthey are still fawn dogs with black stripes in addition the breed standards state that the fawn background must clearly contrast with or show through the brindling a red fawn s with white markings covering more than one third of their coat  conventionally called white s  are neither albino nor rare approximately 2025 of all s born are white 12 genetically these dogs are either fawn or brindle with excessive white markings overlying the base coat color like fair skinned humans white s have a higher risk of sunburn and associated skin cancers than colored s the extreme piebald gene which is responsible for white markings in s is linked to congenital sensorineural deafness in dogs it is estimated that about 18 of white s are deaf in one or both ears 13 though rescue organizations see about double that number 14 15 s were originally a docked and cropped breed and this is still done in some countries however due to pressure from veterinary associations animal rights groups and the general public both cropping of the ears and docking of the tail have been prohibited in many countries around the world a line of naturally short tailed bobtail s was developed in the united kingdom in anticipation of a tail docking ban there 9 after several generations of controlled breeding these dogs were accepted in the kennel club uk registry in 1998 and today representatives of the bobtail line can be found in many countries around the world however in 2008 the fci added a naturally stumpy tail as a disqualifying fault in their breed standard meaning those s born with a bobtail can no longer be shown in fci member countries in the united states and canada as of 2012 cropped ears are still more common in show dogs even though the practice of cosmetic cropping is currently opposed by the american veterinary medical association 10 in march 2005 the akc breed standard was changed to include a description of the uncropped ear but to severely penalize an undocked tail the tail of a is typically docked before the cartilage is fully formed between 35 days old this procedure does not require any anesthesia or sutures when performed at this young age reverse brindle cropped and docked the head is the most distinctive feature of the the breed standard dictates that it must be in perfect proportion to the body and above all it must never be too light 7 the greatest value is to be placed on the muzzle being of correct form and in absolute proportion to the skull the length of the muzzle to the whole of the head should be a ratio of 1 3 folds are always present from the root of the nose running downwards on both sides of the muzzle and the tip of the nose should lie somewhat higher than the root of the muzzle in addition a should be slightly prognathous i e the lower jaw should protrude beyond the upper jaw and bend slightly upwards in what is commonly called an underbite or undershot bite 8

Cairn_Terrier,although the breed had existed long before the name was a compromise suggestion after the breed was originally brought to official shows in the united kingdom in 1909 under the name short haired skye s this name was not acceptable to the kennel club due to opposition from skye breeders and the name was suggested as an alternative they are usually left pawed 3 which has been shown in dogs to correlate to superior performance in tasks related to scent s are ratters it is wise to have a pet examined to rule out heritable skin diseases if a is obtained from unknown sources i e pet stores rescues or puppy mills citation needed s are particularly easily trained ethical breeders strongly suggest obedience school or some other type of training to direct s focus on the owner as the one in command if they are going to be used for hunting if allowed to take control of the household behavior problems may develop that can only be resolved by hiring a professional dog trainer many breeders only sell puppies to dedicated dog owners who agree to basic obedience school these dogs are generally healthy and live on average about 12 to 17 years 6 7 s originated in the highlands of scotland and the isle of skye 4 initially grouped in the skye class alongside the scottish and west highland white s in the early 1900s the three breeds began to be bred separately the kennel club uk gave the a separate register in 1912 during which year 134 were registered and it was in this year that the breed was also given championship status 5 the is one of the oldest of the breeds originating in the scottish highlands and recognized as one of scotland s earliest working dogs the breed was given the name because the breed s function was to hunt and chase quarry between the s in the scottish highlands 2 some of the more common hereditary health problems found in the are 8 breeders owners and veterinarians have identified several health problems that are significant for s some of these diseases are hereditary while others occur as a result of nonspecific factors i e infections toxins injuries or advanced age currently the club of america along with the institute for genetic disease control in animals maintains an open registry for s in hopes of reducing the occurrence of hereditary diseases within the breed breeders voluntarily submit their dogs test results for research purposes as well as for use by individuals who seek to make sound breeding decisions ancestors are from scotland where the wire coat repels water and keeps the dog dry even in rainy or damp climates keeping the coat in its original state will prevent possible skin irritations as dead hair is removed by stripping the coat new growth comes in and the skin and coat remain healthy clipper cutting a might destroy the protective wire coat unique to this breed s exist happily in an apartment if sufficiently exercised citation needed they are very active indoors and suffice even without a yard citation needed daily walks help keep s happy and healthy fenced in yards are strongly recommended for safety and well being as well as being kept on leash when not in the yard s shed very little but should always be hand stripped using scissors or shears can ruin the dog s rugged outer coat after one grooming hand stripping involves pulling the old dead hair out by the roots if done incorrectly this can cause discomfort to the dog causing it to shy away from future hand stripping removing the dead hair in this manner allows new growth to come in this new growth helps protect the dog from water and dirt

Chinese_Shar-Pei,nearly all dog breeds genetic closeness to the gray wolf is due to admixture 3 however several arctic dog breeds show a genetic closeness with the now extinct taymyr wolf of north asia due to admixture these breeds are associated with high latitudes the siberian husky and greenland dog that are also associated with arctic human populations and to a lesser extent the shar pei and finnish spitz an admixture graph of the greenland dog indicates a best fit of 3 5 shared material however an ancestry proportion ranging between 1 4 and 27 3 is consistent with the data this indicates admixture between the taymyr wolf population and the ancestral dog population of these 4 high latitude breeds this introgression could have provided early dogs living in high latitudes with phenotypic variation beneficial for adaption to a new and challenging environment it also indicates the ancestry of present day dog breeds descends from more than one region 4 the shar pei s pigmentation resembles the chow chow as they have been crossed before probably giving them the same blue black tongue there are over sixteen recognized colors in the akc standard the coat must be solid in color and any shar pei with a flowered coat spotted or black and tan in coloration i e rottweiler is a disqualification colors include black blue cream fawn red fawn red sable apricot chocolate and isabella the nose may be black or brick pink with black with or without a black mask a shar pei can also have what is called a dilute coloration meaning the nose nails and anus of the dog are the same color as the coat i e chocolate coat with chocolate nose nails and anus all of these color variations are acceptable but the coat color must be solid and well blended throughout the whole body of the dog small triangle ears and a high set tail also give the shar pei a unique look for show standard the tail is thick and round at the base tapering to a fine point akc standard february 28 1998 as puppies shar pei are a lot more wrinkly than adults and although some adults can be wrinklier than their puppy self an adult pei should have wrinkles mostly on the face a few on their shoulder and at the base of the tail the chinese shar pei is a breed of dog known for its distinctive features of deep wrinkles and a blue black tongue the breed originates from china the english name pinyin sh pí probably derived from british spelling of the cantonese equivalent s pèih which translates to sand skin and refers to the texture of its short rough coat as puppies shar pei have numerous wrinkles but as they mature these loosen and spread out as they grow into their skin shar pei were named in 1978 as one of the world s rarest dog breeds by time magazine and the guinness world records although the shar pei has been identified as a basal breed that predates the emergence of the modern breeds in the 19th century the american kennel club did not recognize it as a breed until 1992 2 all shar pei puppies need early socialization with children strangers and other animals some people may experience a sensitivity to the harshness of the coat of either length this is a mild short lived rash that can develop on the skin that has been in contact with the coat most commonly on the forearms the chinese shar pei is a unique and intelligent dog most often recognized for its wrinkles initially developed as a chinese farm and hunting and later fighting dog the breed does well today in obedience agility herding and tracking with skills that would have been needed on the farm because the name shar pei means sand coat harshness is a distinctive feature in its two accepted coat types either horse short or brush up to an inch long other unique qualities include black mouth pigment a slightly hippo like head shape small ears deep set eyes and rising top line any coat longer than one inch at the withers is called a bear coat and is not considered breed standard as it occurs only when both the male and female carry recessive coat genes this coat length resembles the coat of the chow chow and was probably inherited from the chows the personality of the bear coat is very much like that of a brush coat 46 scientists from the department of genome sciences at the university of washington seattle announced in january 2010 that they had analysed the genetic code of 10 different pedigree dog breeds in the shar pei they discovered four small differences located in the gene has2 which is responsible for making hyaluronic acid synthase 2 that enzyme makes hyaluronic acid which is one of the key components of the skin there have been rare cases in which a mutation of the same gene has caused severe wrinkling in humans as well 6 the traditional shar pei that is most popular in china is more faithful to the history of the breed taller less wrinkly flatter mouth and nose horse coated as puppies they have lots of wrinkles and as they get older they get fewer wrinkles this breed sheds normally twice a year 5 horse coat unusual but regaining ground rough to the touch extremely prickly and off standing soft in one direction and harsh in the other brush coat with longer hair and a smoother feel and bear coat rare and not recognized by the akc bearcoats are due to the addition of other breeds examples of the breed were owned by the peasant class and were used for working dogs and fighting due to their loose skin shar pei can be seen in chinese art throughout history and are considered to be one of the oldest dog breeds on earth western shar pei comes in three different coat types horse brush and bear coat the unusual horse coat is rough to the touch extremely prickly and off standing and is closer to the original traditional shar pei breed in appearance and coat type than the brush or bear coat this coat is fairly prickly and can be rough or irritating when petting in the opposite direction of the fur the horse coat is generally thought to be more active and predisposed to dominant behavior than the brush coat the brush coated variety have slightly longer hair and a smoother feel to them the brush coat is generally considered to be more of a couch potato than the horse coat

century work the master of game introduces them as another kind of hound there is that be called hounds for the hawk and s for their kind cometh from spain notwithstanding that there are many in other countries 2 the master of game was mostly an english translation of an earlier 14th century old french work by gaston iii of foix béarn entitled livre de chasse 3 in 1801 sydenham edwards wrote in cynographia britannica that the land is divided into two types the hawking springing springer and the cocking 4 the term came from the dog s use in hunting woodcocks 5 during the 19th century a was a type of small field at the time this term referred to a number of different hunting breeds including the norfolk sussex and clumber while there were no sussex s or clumber s there were dogs known as welsh s and devonshire s 6 the welsh or devonshire were considered s until 1903 when they were recognized by the kennel club as the welsh springer 7 s were first mentioned in the 14th century by gaston iii of foix béarn in his work the livre de chasse the cocking or was a type of field or land in the 19th century prior to 1901 s were only separated from field s and springer s by weight two dogs are considered to be the foundation sires of both modern breeds the english variety are descended from ch obo while the american breed descends from obo s son ch obo ii in the united states the english was recognized as separate from the native breed in 1946 in the uk the american type was recognized as a separate breed in 1970 in addition there is a second strain of english a working strain which is not bred to a standard but to working ability both breeds share similar coat colors and health issues with a few exceptions rare colours can appear unexpectedly in certain lines for instance while an all white is usually bred by selective breeding of very light golden strains they can still appear very uncommonly to parents who are dark colored a noted occurrence of this happened in 1943 when a grandson of my own brucie best in show at the westminster kennel club dog show in 1940 and 1941 was born all white 19 there are two dogs which are thought to be the foundation sires of both modern breeds of s ch obo is considered by breed enthusiasts to be the father of the modern english while his son ch obo ii is considered to be the progenitor of the american 12 obo was born in 1879 at which point registration as a was still only by size and not by ancestry he was the son of a sussex and a field 7 although obo was an english dog obo ii was born on american shores  his mother was shipped to the united states while pregnant 12 during his lifetime it was claimed in advertisements that obo ii was the sire or grandsire of nearly every prize winning in america 13 s are dogs belonging to two breeds of the dog type the american and the english both of which are commonly called simply in their countries of origin in the early 20th century s also included small hunting s there are two modern breeds of the english and the american 14 they were bred as gun dogs to use their sense of smell to cover low areas near the handler in order to flush birds into the air to be shot and to use their eyes and nose to locate the bird once downed and then to retrieve the bird with a soft mouth 15 the major differences between the english and american varieties is that the american is smaller with a shorter back a domed head and a shorter muzzle while the english variety is taller with a narrower head and chest 14 s were originally bred as hunting dogs in the united kingdom with the term deriving from their use to hunt the eurasian woodcock when the breed was brought to the united states it was bred to a different standard which enabled it to specialize in hunting the american woodcock further physical changes were bred into the in the united states during the early part of the 20th century prior to the 1870s the only requirement for a dog to be classed as a was that it needed to weigh less than 25 pounds 11 kg although breeders separated the from the king charles which remains a smaller breed of 8 this maximum weight limit remained on the until 1900 with larger dogs being classed as springer s 9 the colors of the devonshire and welsh s were described by john henry walsh under the pseudonym stonehenge in his book the dog in health and disease as being a deeper shade of liver than that of the sussex 10 following the formation of the kennel club in the uk in 1873 efforts were made by breeders to record the pedigrees of s and springers in 1892 english s and english springer s were recognized as separate breeds by the kennel club 11 coats come in a variety of colors including black liver red and golden in solids 16 there are also black and tan and sometimes liver and tan as well as a variety of color mixtures of those solid colors including roans roan and tans tricolors and those solid colors with additional white markings 17 18
Collie,the exact origin of the name is uncertain it may derive from the scots word for coal 1 alternatively it may come from the related word coolly referring to the black faced mountain sheep of scotland 2 the name usually refers to dogs of scottish origin which have spread into many other parts of the world often being called sheepdog or shepherd dog elsewhere 3 the temperament of these breeds has been featured in literature film and popular television programs the novels of albert payson terhune which were very popular in the united states during the 1920s and 1930s celebrated the temperament and companionship of his early akc s more famously the temperament and intelligence of the rough were exaggerated to mythic proportions in the character lassie which has been the subject of many films books and television shows from 1938 to the present some breeds especially the rough and the smooth are affected by a genetic defect a mutation within the mdr1 gene 10 affected dogs are very sensitive to some drugs such as ivermectin as well as to some antibiotics opioids and steroids  over 100 drugs in total affected dogs also show a lower cortisol concentration than normal the verband für das deutsche hundewesen the german kennel club encourages breed clubs to test all breeding stock and avoid breeding from affected dogs common use of the name in some areas is limited largely to certain breeds  such as to the rough in parts of the united states or to the border in many rural parts of great britain many types do not actually include in their name herding dogs of type have long been widespread in britain and these can be regarded as a landrace from which a number of other landraces types and formal breeds have been derived both in britain and elsewhere many of them are working herding dogs but some have been bred for conformation showing and as pets sometimes losing their working instincts in the course of selection for appearance or for a more subdued temperament 11 the lassie character was featured in a book titled lassie come home by eric p knight knight s tootsie was the inspiration for the book which was a collection of stories based on her and other legends he collected from talking to friends and neighbors one such story was most likely the documented tale of silverton bobbie the oregon who crossed the us to get to his owners while the dogs who played lassie on screen were from akc lines the actual tootsie looked nothing like them although she did come from a breeder certain types of for example rough s smooth s shetland sheepdogs and some strains of border and other breeds have been bred for many generations as pets and for the sport of conformation showing not as herding dogs all dog breeds have proved to be highly trainable gentle loyal intelligent and well suited as pets 7 8 9 their gentleness and devotion also make them quite compatible with children they are often more suitable as watchdogs than as guard dogs though the individual personalities of these dogs vary the is a distinctive type of herding dog including many related landraces and standardised breeds the type originated in scotland and northern england the is a medium sized fairly lightly built dog with a pointed snout many types have a distinctive white pattern over the shoulders s are very active and agile and most types of s have a very strong herding instinct breeds have spread through many parts of the world especially australia and north america and have diversified into many varieties sometimes with mixture from other dog types some breeds have remained as working dogs used for herding cattle sheep and other livestock while others are kept as pets show dogs or for dog sports in which they display great agility stamina and trainability while the akc has a breed they call in fact dogs are a distinctive type of herding dog including many related landraces and formal breeds there are usually major distinctions between show dogs and those bred for herding trials or dog sports they typically display great agility stamina and trainability and more importantly sagacity s may have a genetic disease canine cyclic neutropenia or grey syndrome this is a stem cell disorder puppies with this disorder are quite often mistaken for healthy blue merles even though their colour is a silver grey affected puppies rarely live more than 6 months for a puppy to be affected both the sire and the dam have to be carriers of the disorder a working member of the breed such as the border is an extremely energetic and agile dog with great stamina when in fit working condition they are able to run all day without tiring even over very rough or steep ground 5 working s display a keen intelligence for the job at hand and are instinctively highly motivated they are often intensely loyal dogs of type or derivation occupy four of the first sixteen ranks in stanley coren s the intelligence of dogs with the border being first these characteristics generally make working strains suitable for agility in addition to herding work they are well suited to active sports such as sheepdog trials flyball disc dog and dog agility working strains have strong herding instincts and some individuals can be single minded to the point of obsessiveness s can compete in herding events 6 s are generally medium sized dogs of about 22 to 32 kg 48 to 70 lb and light to medium boned cattle herding types are more stocky the fur may be short flat or long and the tail may be smooth feathered or bushy s can have both naturally long or naturally bobbed tails some breed clubs historically dock the tail the tail can be carried low with an upward swirl or twist or high over the back the tail never curls at the base or touches the back each breed can vary in coloration with the usual base colors being black black and tan red red and tan or sable they often have white along with the main color usually under the belly and chest over the shoulders and on parts of the face and legs but sometimes leaving only the head colored  or white may be absent or limited to the chest and toes as in the australian kelpie merle coloration may also be present over any of the other color combinations even in landrace types the most widespread patterns include sable black and white and tricolour black and tan and white also known as black sable s range in trainability from the average to very biddable the border is also the breed most in need of a job while other breeds fit well into an active family lifestyle 4
Coton_de_Tulear,multiple registries with differing standards scribe the but it generally has very soft hair as opposed to fur 2 comparable to a cotton ball hence its name in french meaning cotton a prominent black nose large expressive eyes usually covered by bangs and somewhat short legs the s tail should curl over its back the nose is black in colour in the club of america standard however the fédération cynologique internationale standard which also favors a black nose states that brown is tolerable as well a pink or partly pink nose is not accepted in either standard the standard advocates that the lips should preferably be tight and of the same colour as the nose specifically black in the club of america standard a s teeth can be either in a scissor bite or pincer bite its eyes are normally round dark in colour and wi set traditionally the expression is lively intelligent bright and merry typically the s ears are triangular and set high the leather of the ear is often thin and the neck is strong favoured to be without a wlap and slightly arched the tuléar has a medium to long fluffy cotton like coat that is consired hair rather than fur 2 it is a non shedding breed with low danr when it is a puppy it may shed its puppy coat like the poodle or havanese this breed has very low allergic effects and is consired hypoallergenic matted hair should be removed through daily brushing and combing grooming the can be quite a challenge 3 4 this breed does not have the common doggie smell and when properly bathed and groomed has little to no odor the tuléar is a breed of small dog named for the city of tuléar in madagascar and for its cotton like coat the fédération cynologique internationale standard gives the s weight as 4 to 6 kg 8 8 to 13 2 lb for males and 3 5 to 5 kg 7 7 to 11 0 lb for females the s height including tolerance is 25 to 30 cm 9 8 to 11 8 in tall for males and 22 to 27 cm 8 7 to 10 6 in for females 1 the has few health issues compared to many other breeds due to being rather generic in type it is a fairly rare breed and is just now being accepted and recognized by the akc as of 2012 the fact that this is a breed being revived from extinction means that the is rather expensive to purchase and prices may reach $1 800 00 $3 500 per dog the average life span of a is 14 to 19 years 8 the chest is typically well veloped and reaches to fci standard n° 283 04 02 2000 gb the elbows a s feet are small and arched and its back is normally strong and slightly arched the pads of the feet are usually black the body is of morate length and typically has a morate tuck up traditionally the loin is muscular and not overly long in length the hind legs are normally strong and straight the hind feet are similar to the front feet throughout history the wclaws have been removed however many would now oppose this arguably unnecessary and cruel procedure 7 the tail is traditionally low set and tapering carried over the back when in motion or excited but relaxed otherwise the is a playful affectionate intelligent breed although generally quiet it can become very vocal grunting barking and making other noises when having fun s are known to have a habit of jumping up and walking on their hind legs to please people most s love meeting new people and are very curious in new situations s are easy to train as they are very eager to please s are great with kids and other animals the has a large dog personality much like the lab citation need s love to swim run and play they adapt well to any kind of living environment a common trait of the behavior is to come alive in the evening the is in general a healthy breed however there are still some health issues as there are in all breeds the most serious issues are heart problems liver shunts back disc problems and eye problems luckily these are still relatively uncommon in the breed the small gene pool of this breed is owing to its near extinction due to inbreeding by disreputable breers there is an increased incince of disease the smaller the gene pool the more likely a breed is to have genetic abnormalities the has a coat that requires brushing and combing almost daily and bathing about once per week to maintain its beauty s love swimming owners who have pools are recommend to let their s play in the pool with supervision like poodles they do not shed meaning they don t drop hair on furniture carpeting etc they do lose hair the texture of their coat causes the shed hair to be trapped in the coat if not brushed and combed daily the fur of this breed will mat up quickly and may require shaving s need a walk every day for exercise but will appreciate a play session as often as possible and have the endurance to go on a long hike s love to play with other dogs and they are great with kids the comes in three accepted colors white sometimes with tan markings all white is preferred by show breers black and white and tricolor however the tan and white may become all white the blacks will often fa to grey or white and fur will most likely change throughout puppyhood the breed even has a fa gene that causes the colors which are very dark when a puppy to fa and turn white at the base of the hair as it lengthens that is why the champagne or champagne teddy bear eventually turns white when the adult hair comes in the fédération cynologique internationale standard specifies that the s coat should be white but may also have tan or lemon color on their ears and body the coat however must be primarily white with no black hair the us based club of america allows for three different but equally favorable colorings white black and white and tri color which inclus honey bear white is scribed as nearly all white sometimes with tan or champagne coloring on the ears face or back black and white is fined as pure white with prominent black patches on the head and body no ratio of white to black is specified or favored tri color is scribed as mostly white with some brown markings and dustings of black on the body and head a honey bear tri color has light brown with black tips that gradually fas to an off white or lemon color the tri color loses the most color of any of the color varieties usually becoming mostly white with possibly some champagne markings and a dusting of black hairs on the ears and or body 5 however the club of america standard specifies the weight as no more than 18 lb 8 2 kg with the average being between 11 to 15 lb 5 0 to 6 8 kg the standard height is 9 to 13 in 23 to 33 cm except for the rare tall which is 15 to 17 in 38 to 43 cm tall the long limbed tall shows up in all three color varieties and can be born to a litter with normal sized parents that carry the appropriate genes 6
Dachshund,the name is of german origin and literally means badger dog from dachs badger and hund hound dog the pronunciation varies widely in english variations of the first and second syllables include d ks dæks and h nt h nd nd although is a german word in modern german they are more commonly known by the name dackel or among hunters teckel the german word is pronounced daksh nt 4 s also participate in conformation shows field trials and many other events organized through pure bred dog organizations such as the american kennel club akc according to the akc the remains one of the top 10 dog breeds in the united states 3 the standard size was developed to scent chase and flush out badgers and other burrow dwelling animals while the miniature was bred to hunt smaller prey such as rabbits in the united states they have also been used to track wounded deer and hunt prairie dogs because of their long narrow build they are often nicknamed wiener dog or sausage dog may be erroneously pronounced and or spelled dash hound dash hound or dashound by some english speakers s come in three sizes standard miniature 8 and kaninchen german for rabbit although the standard and miniature sizes are recognized almost universally the rabbit size is not recognized by clubs in the united states and the united kingdom the rabbit size is recognized by the fédération cynologique internationale world canine federation fci which contain kennel clubs from 83 countries all over the world 9 an increasingly common size for family pets falls between the miniature and the standard size frequently referred to as tweenies not an official classification 10 the uk dæks nd or us d ksh nt dahks huunt or d ks nt 2 is a short legged long bodied hound type dog breed being the owner of s to me a book on dog discipline becomes a volume of inspired humor every sentence is a riot some day if i ever get a chance i shall write a book or warning on the character and temperament of the and why he can t be trained and shouldn t be i would rather train a striped zebra to balance an indian club than induce a to heed my slightest command when i address fred i never have to raise either my voice or my hopes he even disobeys me when i instruct him in something he wants to do a typical is long bodied and muscular with short stubby legs its front paws are unusually large and paddle shaped for extreme digging it has skin that is loose enough not to tear while tunneling in tight burrows to chase prey the has a deep chest that provides increased lung capacity for stamina when hunting prey underground its snout is long with an increased nose area that absorbs odors 7 s are playful but as hunting dogs can be quite stubborn 16 and are known for their propensity for chasing small animals birds and tennis balls with great determination and ferocity 17 18 19 many s are stubborn making them a challenge to train 18 20 21 22 23 the club of america dca and the american kennel club akc consider both the piebald pattern and the double dapple double merle pattern to be nonstandard however both types continue to be shown and sometimes even win in the conformation ring a wirehaired dogs that are double dappled have the merle pattern of a dapple but with distinct white patches that occur when the dapple gene expresses itself twice in the same area of the coat the dca excluded the wording double dapple from the standard in 2007 and now strictly use the wording dapple as the double dapple gene is commonly responsible for blindness and deafness h l mencken said that a is a half dog high and a dog and a half long 12 although they have been referred to as two dogs long 13 this characteristic has led them to be quite a recognizable breed and they are featured in many a joke and cartoon particularly the far side by gary larson 14 a full grown standard averages 16 lb 7 3 kg to 32 lb 15 kg while the miniature variety normally weighs less than 12 lb 5 4 kg 8 the kaninchen weighs 8 lb 3 6 kg to 11 lb 5 0 kg according to kennel club standards the miniature and kaninchen where recognized differs from the full size only by size and weight thus offspring from miniature parents must never weigh more than the miniature standard to be considered a miniature as well 8 while many kennel club size divisions use weight for classification such as the american kennel club other kennel club standards determine the difference between the miniature and standard by chest circumference some kennel clubs such as in germany even measure chest circumference in addition to height and weight 11 wall eye is permissible according to dca standards piebald patterned s will never have blue in their eyes unless the dapple pattern is present light colored s can sport amber light brown or green eyes however kennel club standards state that the darker the eye color the better they can also have eyes of two different colors however this is only found in dapple and double dapple s 15 s can have a blue and a brown eye blue eyes partially blue eyes or a blue eye and a brown eye are called wall coloring and are considered a non desirable trait in kennel club standards dappled eyes are also possible while classified in the hound group or scent hound group in the united states and great britain the breed actually has its own group in the countries which belong to the fédération cynologique internationale world canine federation 5 many s especially the wire haired subtype may exhibit behavior and appearance that are similar to that of the terrier group of dogs 6 an argument can be made for the scent or hound group classification because the breed was developed to use scent to trail and hunt animals and probably descended from the saint hubert hound like many modern scent hound breed such as bloodhounds and basset hounds but with the persistent personality and love for digging that probably developed from the terrier it can also be argued that they could belong in the terrier or earth dog group 6 a longhaired a smooth there are three coat varieties smooth coat short hair longhaired and wirehaired 8 longhaired s have a silky coat and short featherings on legs and ears wirehaired s are the least common coat variety in the us it is the most common in germany and the most recent coat to appear in breeding standards 8 s have a wide variety of colors and patterns their base coloration can be single colored either red or cream tan pointed black and tan chocolate and tan blue and tan or isabella and tan and in wirehaired dogs a color referred to as wildboar patterns such as dapple merle sable brindle and piebald also can occur on any of the base colors s in the same litter may be born in different coat colors depending on the genetic makeup of the parents the dominant color in the breed is red followed by black and tan tan pointed dogs have tan or cream markings over the eyes ears paws and tail the reds range from coppers to deep rusts with or without somewhat common black hairs peppered along the back face and ear edges lending much character and an almost burnished appearance this is referred to among breeders and enthusiasts as an overlay or sabling sabling should not be confused with a more unusual coat color referred to as sable at a distance a sable looks somewhat like a black and tan dog upon closer examination however one can observe that along the top of the dog s body each hair is actually banded with red at the base near the skin transitioning to mostly black along the length of the strand an additional striking coat marking is the brindle pattern brindle refers to dark stripes over a solid backgroundusually red if a is brindled on a dark coat and has tan points it will have brindling on the tan points only even one single lone stripe of brindle is a brindle if a has one single spot of dapple it is a dapple
Dalmatian,hip dysplasia is another disease that affects nearly 5 of purebred s 22 causing those to experience limping fatigue moderate to severe pain and trouble standing up most s who eventually develop hip dysplasia are born with normal hips but the soft tissues surrounding the joint grow abnormally due to their genetic make up the disease may affect both hips or only the right or left hip leading afflicted dogs to walk or run with an altered gait 23 blue eyed s are thought to have a greater incidence of deafness than brown eyed s although a mechanism of association between the two characteristics has yet to be conclusively established 20 some kennel clubs discourage the use of blue eyed dogs in breeding programs 21 s like humans can suffer from hyperuricemia 24 s livers have trouble breaking down uric acid which can build up in the blood serum hyperuricemia causing gout uric acid can also be excreted in high concentration into the urine causing kidney stones and bladder stones these conditions are most likely to occur in middle aged males males over 10 are prone to kidney stones and should have their calcium intake reduced or be given preventive medication 25 to reduce the risk of gout and stones owners should carefully limit the intake of purines by avoiding giving their dogs food containing organ meats animal byproducts or other high purine ingredients hyperuricemia in s responds to treatment with orgotein the veterinary formulation of the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase 26 the is a large 3 well defined muscular dog with excellent endurance and stamina when full grown according to the american kennel club breed standard it stands from 19 to 23 inches 48 to 58 cm tall with males usually slightly larger than females 6 the kennel club in the uk allows a height up to 24 inches 61 cm 2 the body is as long from forechest to buttocks as it is tall at the withers and the shoulders are laid back the s feet are round with well arched toes and the nails are usually white or the same colour as the dog s spots the thin ears taper towards the tip and are set fairly high and close to the head eye color varies between brown amber or blue with some dogs having one blue eye and one brown eye or other combinations 7 the is a breed of large dog 3 noted for its unique black or liver spotted coat and mainly used as a carriage dog in its early days its roots trace back to croatia and its historical region of dalmatia 4 5 today it is a popular family pet and many dog enthusiasts enter s into kennel club competitions puppies are born with plain white coats and their first spots usually appear within 3 to 4 weeks after birth after about a month they have most of their spots although they continue to develop throughout life at a much slower rate spots usually range in size from 30 to 60 mm and are most commonly black or brown liver on a white background other more rare colors include blue a blue grayish color brindle mosaic tricolored with tan spotting on the eyebrows cheeks legs and chest and orange or lemon dark to pale yellow patches of color appear anywhere on the body mostly on the head or ears and usually consist of a solid color 8 a three month old newborn puppies researchers now know deafness in albino and piebald animals is caused by the absence of mature melanocytes in the inner ear 17 this may affect one or both ears the condition is also common in other canine breeds that share a genetic propensity for light pigmentation this includes but is not limited to bull terriers dogo argentinos poodles boxers border collies and great danes citation needed in 2010 the uk kennel club registered a backcrossed called ch fiacres first and foremost several restrictions were imposed on the dog although the dog is at least 13 generations removed from the original pointer cross its f1 to f3 progeny will be marked on registration certificates with asterisks which indicate impure or unverified breeding 31 no progeny will be eligible to be exported as pedigrees for the next five years and all have to be health tested 32 uk breed clubs have objected to the decision by the kennel club 33 s usually have litters of six to nine pups 10 but they have been known to have larger litters on occasion such as a massive eighteen puppy brood born in january 2009 all were healthy 11 puppies three weeks a genetic predisposition for deafness is a serious health problem for s only about 70 have normal hearing 16 deafness was not recognized by early breeders so the breed was thought to be unintelligent even after recognizing the problem as a genetic fault breeders did not understand the dogs nature and deafness in s continues to be a frequent problem citation needed puppies four five weeks typically only dogs with bilateral hearing are bred although those with unilateral hearing and even dogs with bilateral deafness make fine pets with appropriate training 7 the club of america s position on deaf pups is that they should always be euthanized and never be sold or placed to pet homes 18 s with large patches of colour present at birth may have a lower rate of deafness selecting for this trait may reduce the frequency of deafness in the breed 19 however patches are a disqualifying factor in breed standards in an effort to preserve the spotted coat the continual breeding of patched dogs would result in heavily patched s with few spots citation needed the coat is usually short fine and dense however smooth coated s occasionally produce long coated offspring these individuals experience much less shedding than their smooth coated counterparts which shed considerably year round the standard variety s short stiff hairs often weave into carpet clothing upholstery and nearly any other kind of fabric and can be difficult to remove weekly grooming with a hound mitt or curry can lessen the amount of hair s shed although nothing can completely prevent shedding due to the minimal amount of oil in their coats s lack a dog smell and stay fairly clean relative to many other dog breeds 7 9 at the annual general meeting of the dca in may 2006 the backcross issue was discussed again by club members in june of the same year dca members were presented with an opportunity to vote on whether to reopen discussion of the backcross project the results of this ballot were nearly 2 1 in favor of re examining support of the project by the dca this has begun with publication of articles presenting more information both in support of and questioning the need for this project in july 2011 the akc agreed to allow registration of backcrossed s 30 hyperuricemia in s as in all breeds is inherited but unlike other breeds the normal gene for uricase is not present in the breed s gene pool therefore there is no possibility of eliminating hyperuricemia among pure bred s the only possible solution to this problem must then be crossing s with other breeds to reintroduce the normal uricase gene this led to the foundation of the pointer backcross project which aims to reintroduce the normal uricase gene into the breed the backcross used a single english pointer subsequent breedings have all been to purebred s this project was started in 1973 by dr robert schaible the first cross f1 hybrids did not resemble s very closely the f1s were then crossed back to purebreds this breeding produced puppies of closer resemblance to the pure by the fifth generation in 1981 they resembled purebreds so much dr schaible convinced the akc to allow two of the hybrids to be registered as purebreds then akc president william f stifel stated if there is a logical scientific way to correct genetic health problems associated with certain breed traits and still preserve the integrity of the breed standard it is incumbent upon the american kennel club to lead the way 27 the club of america s dca board of directors supported this decision however it quickly became highly controversial among the club members a vote by dca members opposed the registration of the hybrids causing the akc to ban registration to any of the dog s offspring 28 29 s are a relatively healthy and easy to keep breed like other breeds s display a propensity towards certain health problems specific to their breed such as deafness allergies and urinary stones reputable breeders have their puppies baer brainstem auditory evoked response tested to ensure the status of the hearing on their pups the club of america lists the average lifespan of a at between 11 and 13 years although some can live as long as 15 to 16 years 12 breed health surveys in the us and the uk show an average lifespan of 9 9 and 11 55 years respectively 13 14 in their late teens both males and females may suffer bone spurs and arthritic conditions autoimmune thyroiditis may be a relatively common condition for the breed affecting 11 6 of dogs 15
Doberman_Pinscher,traditional black and tan s are well known as intelligent alert and tenaciously loyal companions and guard dogs personality varies a great deal between each individual but if taken care of and trained properly they tend to be loving and devoted companions the is driven strong and sometimes stubborn owning one requires commitment and care but if trained well they can be wonderful family dogs unlike some breeds such as the german shepherd s are eager to please only after their place is established in their pack and that place is not as an alpha with a consistent approach they can be easy to train and will learn very quickly as with all dogs if properly trained they can be excellent with children s adapt quickly though they take their cue from their leader and value attention the german pronun­cia­tion do b man p n or n or is a medium large breed of domestic dog originally developed around 1890 by karl friedrich louis n a tax collector from germany 2 the muzzle is long and so affords the leverage for an extremely strong bite the stands on its toes not the pads and is not usually heavy footed ideally they have an even and graceful gait traditionally the ears are cropped and posted and the tail is docked however in some countries it is illegal to do so s have markings on the chest paws legs muzzle above the eyes and underneath the tail although the breed standards vary among kennel and breed clubs according to the fci standard the dog typically stands between 68 to 72 centimetres 27 to 28 in 1 and the kennel club in the uk quote 69 centimetres 27 in as being ideal 5 the female is typically somewhere between 63 to 68 centimetres 25 to 27 in 1 65 centimetres 26 in being ideal 5 the has a square frame its length should equal its height to the withers and the length of its head neck and legs should be in proportion to its body 3 two different color genes exist in the one for black b and one for color dilution d there are nine possible combinations of these alleles bbdd bbdd bbdd bbdd bbdd bbdd bbdd bbdd bbdd which result in four different color phenotypes black red blue and fawn isabella 6 the traditional and most common color occurs when both the color and dilution genes have at least one dominant allele i e bbdd bbdd bbdd or bbdd and is commonly referred to as black or black and rust also called black and tan the red red

carried erect 14 like tail docking ear cropping is illegal in some countries 15 the s natural tail is fairly long but individual dogs often have a short tail as a result of docking a procedure in which the majority of the tail is surgically removed shortly after birth one black and one blue blue in 1976 a white was whelped 8 and was subsequently bred to her son who was also bred to his litter sisters this tight inbreeding continued for some time to allow the breeders to fix the mutation white s are a cream color with pure white markings and icy blue eyes although this is consistent with albinism the proper characterization of the mutation is currently unknown the animals are commonly known as tyrosinase positive albinoids lacking melanin in oculocutaneous structures 9 this condition is caused by a partial deletion in gene slc45a2 10 the practice of docking has been around for centuries and is older than the as a breed 11 the putative reason for docking is to ensure that the tail does not get in the way of the dog s work 11 docking has always been controversial 12 the american kennel club standard for s includes a tail docked near the 2nd vertebra 3 docking is a common practice in the united states russia and japan as well as a number of other countries with populations where it is legal in many european countries and australia docking has been made illegal and in

and working lines the breed suffers from average health complaints the show bred version of the breed has been linked to rage syndrome although the disorder is very rare it is closely related to the welsh and very closely with the cocker less than a century ago s and cockers would come from the same litter the smaller cockers hunted woodcock while the larger littermates were used to flush or spring game in 1902 the kennel club of england recognized the as a distinct breed 2 they are used as sniffer dogs on a widespread basis the term comes from the historic hunting role where the dog would flush spring birds into the air the typical is friendly eager to please quick to learn and willing to obey 6 in the right circumstances they can be an affectionate and easy going family dog its

of the retina causing vision loss leading to blindness are two such diseases for which veterinarians are working on genetic markers to determine carriers another problem can be elbow dysplasia 9 retinal dysplasia rd which can cause blindness and phosphofructokinase deficiency pfk which is genetic deficiency which impairs the ability of cells using carbohydrates for energy are two other hereditary conditions for which both lines of the should be screened prior to breeding 10 health issues are usually similar in both types of however phosphofructokinase deficiency in particular can appear more in field lines however carriers in show lines have been identified 11 it is a sociable breed that enjoys the company of children and handles the company of other pets well the hunting

brought over in order to set up an american based breeding program they were mostly owned by society ladies who first displayed them at the westminster kennel club dog show in 1896 they arrived again in the following year with even more entries where the judging of the breed would go on to have future ramifications the judge in question at the dog show a mr sven feltstein only chose winners with rose ears  ears that folded at the tip as with the standard for english s the ladies formed the bull dog club of america and created the breed standard which stated for the first time that the erect bat ear was the correct type 12 the small type gradually became thought of as a breed and received a name the bouledogue francais 11 this francization of the english name is also a contraction of the words boule ball and dogue mastiff or molosser the dogs were highly fashionable and were sought after by society ladies and parisian prostitutes alike as well as creatives such as artists writers and fashion designers 11 however records were not kept of the breed s development as it diverged further away from its original roots as it changed terrier and pug stock may have been brought in to develop traits such as the breed s long straight ears and the roundness of their eyes 11 in 2014 they were the fourth most popular registered dog in the united kingdom 4 and in the u s the ninth most popular akc registered dog breed 5 6 they were rated the third most popular dog in australia for 2017 7 this new breed arrived for the first time in england in 1893 with english breeds in uproar as the imports did not meet the new breed standards in place by this time and wanted to prevent the english stock from cross breeding with the the kennel club initially recognised them as a subset of the existing english breed rather than an entirely new breed 11 some english breeders in this period bred the s in order to resurrect the toy breed 9 on 10 july 1902 at the house of frederick w cousens a meeting was held to set up a breed club in order to seek individual recognition for the breed 12 the adopted breed standard was the same one which was already in use in america france germany and austria 9 despite opposition from miniature the new breed name for the toy and breeders 15 in 1905 the kennel club changed its policy on the breed and recognised them separate from the english variety

8 acceptable colors under the breed standard are the various shades of brindle fawn tan or white with brindle patches known as pied the most common colors are brindle then fawn with pieds being less common than the other colors the breed clubs do not recognize any other colors or patterns this is because some colors come linked with genetic health problems not usually found in the breed most notably blue coloration which is linked with a form of alopecia hair loss or baldness sometimes known as blue dog alopecia 17 although this is heavily disputed by some organizations 18 there does

revolution began to settle in normandy france 9 they brought a variety of dogs with them including miniature s 10 the dogs became popular in france and a trade in imported small s was created with breeders in england sending over s that they considered to be too small or with faults such as ears that stood up by 1860 there were few miniature s left in england such was their popularity in france and due to the exploits of specialist dog exporters 11 the also known as the ie is a small breed of domestic dog ies were the result in the 1800s of a cross between ancestors imported from england and

forth the official breed standard for all breeds recognized by the akc including the the should have the appearance of an active muscular dog of heavy bone smooth coat compactly built and of medium or small structure the points should be well distributed and bear good relation one to the other no feature being in such prominence from either excess or lack of quality that the animal appears deformed or poorly proportioned in comparison to specimens of different gender due allowance should be made in favor of the female dogs which do not bear the characteristics of the breed to the same marked degree as do the male dogs blood sports such as bull baiting were outlawed in england in 1835 leaving these s unemployed 8 however they had been bred for non sporting reasons since at least 1800 and so their use changed from a sporting breed to a companion breed to reduce their size some s were crossed with terriers while others were crossed with pugs by 1850 the toy had become common in england and appeared in conformation shows when they began around 1860 citation needed these dogs weighed around 1625 pounds 7 311 3 kg although classes were also available at dog shows for those that weighed under 12 pounds 5 4 kg 8

Havanese,the is small in size and sturdy in structure with a tail carried over its back and ears that drop and fold the coat is abundant long and silky and comes in all colors 1 the has a spirited personality and a curious disposition and is notable for its springy gait a characteristic that distinguishes the breed from all others 3 the is considered an ideal family pet and a true companion dog 1 they are highly adaptable to almost any environment because of their strong social needs will not thrive in an environment where they are isolated for several hours each day the breed standard notes that except for slight trimming around the feet to allow for a tidy foot they are to be shown untrimmed 1 any further trimming back combing or other fussing is against type and will not be allowed to the point of precluding placement in dog shows the breed standard specifies that the tail may not be docked the american kennel club standard allows head furnishings above each eye to be held in two small braids secured with plain elastic bands however many owners prefer to clip their pet s hair short for easy upkeep although there are a few arguments on whether the original were all white or of different colors modern are acceptable in all coat colors and patterns all colored dogs should have a black nose and black pigment around the eyes with the exception of chocolate brown dogs which may have dark brown pigment on their nose instead examples of coat colors are white cream fawn red chocolate brown beige gold silver blue and black the coat may be one solid color or have markings in one or more other colors for example sable brindle black tan tri color irish pied parti colored belton or piebald black and white beige black and white a unique aspect of the breed is the topline which rises just slightly from withers to croup creating a topline that is straight but not level renowned for their flashy lively gait when on the move their strong rear drive and slightly shorter upper arm produce a springy motion rather than a far reaching one the angle of the topline does not change while moving at a natural gait while a toy dog 1 are sturdy and not overly delicate most are 10 to 16 pounds 4 5 to 7 3 kg and 8 5 to 11 5 inches 22 to 29 cm with the ideal being 9 to 10 5 inches 23 to 27 cm at the withers the body measured from point of shoulder to point of buttocks is slightly longer than the height at the withers giving the dog the appearance of being slightly longer than tall the length of the body results from the long ribcage not the loins the a breed of bichon type is the national dog of cuba developed from the now extinct blanquito de la habana little white dog of havana the blanquito descended from the also now extinct bichon tenerife it is believed that the blanquito was eventually cross bred with other bichon types including the poodle to create what is now known as the sometimes referred to as havana silk dogs this was originally another name for the blanquito de la habana the coat is long soft lightweight and silky the coat is slightly wavy profuse and undulating unlike other double coated breeds the outer coat is neither coarse nor overly dense but rather soft and light the undercoat is sometimes completely absent the coat should be very soft almost cool to the touch like unrefined silk compared to the maltese coat which feels like refined silk however in some dogs the coat can become too silky looking oily on the other end of the spectrum coats can be too harsh or cottony giving a frizzy appearance because of the tropical nature of the the fine and lightweight coat is designed to act as a sunshade and cooling agent on hot days this means that though the coat is abundant and may appear warm the must be protected from the cold these dogs become cold very easily so keeping their coat longer in winter time is essential especially since these dogs originate from hot weather the length from foot to elbow is equal to the length from elbow to withers the forechest is pronounced when in a standing position the sternum lines up with the elbows creating a deep chest ribs are well sprung and the abdomen is moderately tucked up 3 the has dark brown eyes and almond shaped lids surrounded by black pigment the ears when extended reach half way to the nose they arc slightly upward at the base and hang down on the sides of the head without touching the face the tail is carried arched forward up over the back while the tail s long plume of hair falls on the body the tail itself never touches the back black and white the coat is shown naturally brushed out or in some countries it may be corded a technique which turns the long coat into cords of hair similar to dreadlocks in humans this corded look may be difficult to achieve for the first timer so it is always recommended that someone interested in cording their consults someone who has done it before brushing out their fur is essential this breed s fur grows very fast and without brushing it the fur can become tangled easily also even though this breed is hypoallergenic have hair that doesn t fall off shed but it still needs to be groomed the muzzle is full and tapers slightly at the nose it does not have the appearance of being short or snipy length of skull measured from stop to point of occiput is equal to the length of muzzle the top of the skull is rather flat and the backskull is rounded
Italian_Greyhound,the in piccolo levriero o is a small breed of dog of the sighthound type sometimes called an i g or an 1 lure coursing is well fitted to the and they seem to enjoy it tremendously although the is a very fast dog it is not as well suited to racing as its larger cousin regardless many s participate in amateur straight track and oval track racing the s chest is deep with a tucked up abdomen long slender legs and a long neck that tapers down to a small head the head is long and pointed like a full sized overall they look like miniature s though many owners dispute the use of the term miniature in reference to the breed itself by definition of the american kennel club 4 they are true genetic s with a bloodline extending back over 2 000 years their current small stature is a function of selective breeding their gait is distinctive and should be high stepping and free rather like that of a horse they are able to run at top speed with a double suspension gallop 5 and can achieve a top speed of up to 25 miles per hour 40 km h recognised coat colours in the uk are black blue grey red and fawn for the kennel club uk all colours except brindle are accepted for the american kennel club and the australian national kennel council parti colored s are accepted while the fci standard for international shows allows white only on the chest and feet coat colours of black blue and isabelle fawn exist in all nuances 6 the modern s appearance is a result of breeders throughout europe particularly austrian german french and british making great contributions to the forming of this breed the should resemble a small or rather a sloughi the makes a good companion dog and enjoys the company of people however the breed s slim build and short coat make them somewhat fragile and injury can result from rough or careless play with children the breed is good with the elderly or a couple without any children for it prefers a quiet household but they are also generally fine with older children they also are equally at home in the city or the country although they tend to do best in spacious areas they are fast agile and athletic like any dog daily exercise is a must for a happier well adjusted pet s love to run the young dog is often particularly active and this high level of activity may lead them to attempt ill advised feats of athleticism that can result in injury due to their size and in some lineages poor bone density they are prone to broken legs s make reasonably good watchdogs as they bark at unfamiliar sounds they may also bark at passers by and other animals however they should not be considered true guard dogs as they are often aloof with strangers and easily spooked to run some s enjoy dog agility the breed s lithe body and its love of action provide potential to do well at this sport although not many s participate and their natural inclination is for straight out racing rather than for working tightly as a team with a handler on a technical course as gazehounds s instinctively hunt by sight and have an extremely high predator drive owners of s should typically keep their dogs leashed at all times when not in an enclosed area to avoid the risk of even a well behaved pet breaking away at high speed after a small animal like most sight hounds because the s slender skull is near the same width as its neck the use of a martingale collar is advised for walking the collar tightens up when pulled while remaining comfortably slack when the dog is walking politely this prevents the dog from backing out and escaping breakaway collars are advised for identification because this active and acrobatic breed could easily injure themselves when put in a collar they cannot escape from and this leads to possible neck injuries and strangling the is the smallest 2 of the sighthounds typically weighing about 8 to 15 lb 3 6 to 6 8 kg and standing about 13 to 15 inches 33 to 38 cm tall at the shoulder 3 they are in the toy group in the uk and us but in the sighthound group in the fédération cynologique internationale fci
Jack_Russell_Terrier,s are an energetic breed that rely on a high level of exercise and stimulation and are relatively free from serious health complaints originating from dogs bred and used by reverend john in the early 19th century from whom the breed takes its name the has similar origins to the modern fox it has gone through several changes over the years corresponding to different use and breed standards set by kennel clubs recognition by kennel clubs for the breed has been opposed by the breed s parent societies  which resulted in the breeding and recognition of the parson s have appeared many times in film television and print with several historical dogs of note in the late 1990s the american kennel club explored the possibility of recognising the 21 this move was opposed by the club of america as they did not want the breed to lose its essential working characteristics 22 the breeders association formed and petitioned the akc the breed s admission was granted in 2001 under the akc recognised standard the size of the breed was narrowed from the previous club s standard and the name of the akc recognised was changed to parson 23 with the breeders association renamed to the parson association of america 21 an important attribute in this dog was a tempered aggressiveness that would provide the necessary drive to pursue and bolt the fox without resulting in physical harm to the quarry and effectively ending the chase which was considered unsporting 11 was said to have prided himself that his s never tasted blood 10 this line of s developed by john was well respected for those qualities and his dogs were often taken on by hunt enthusiasts it is unlikely however that any dogs alive today can be proven to be descendants from trump as was forced to sell all his dogs on more than one occasion because of financial difficulty and had only four aged and non breeding s left when he died in 1883 12 the fox and type dogs of today are all descended from dogs of that period although documented pedigrees earlier than 1862 have not been found although several records remain of documented breeding by john between the 1860s and 1880s the fox club was formed in 1875 with as one of the founder members its breed standard was aspiration and not a description of how the breed appeared then by the start of the 20th century the fox had altered more towards the modern breed but in some parts of the country the old style of john s s remained and it is from those dogs that the modern type has descended 4 the head should be of moderate width at the ears narrowing to the eyes and slightly flat between the ears there should be a defined but not overpronounced stop at the end of the muzzle where it meets the head and a black nose the jaw should be powerful and well boned with a scissor bite and straight teeth the eyes are almond shaped and dark coloured and should be full of life and intelligence small v shaped ears of moderate thickness are carried forward on the head 16 when the dog is alert the tip of the v should not extend past the outer corner of the eyes the tail is set high and in the past was docked to approximately five inches in order to provide a sufficient hand hold for gripping the 16 arthur blake heinemann created the first breed standard and in 1894 he founded the devon and somerset badger club the aims of which were to promote badger digging rather than fox hunting and the breeding of s suitable for this purpose s were acquired from nicholas snow of oare and they were likely descended from s original dogs as would probably have hunted at some point with snow s hunting club and is likely to have provided at least some of their original s 4 by the turn of the 20th century s name had become associated with this breed of dog 15 the australian national kennel council ankc and the new zealand kennel club nzck are some of national kennel associations that register both the and the parson 24 however the size requirements for the under both those standards would classify a dog as a in the united states 25 in 2009 there were 1073 s registered with the ankc compared to 18 for the parson 26 other modern breeds are often mistaken for modern s including their cousin the parson 27 the tenterfield 28 and the rat 29 several other modern breeds exist that descended from the early fox breed including the brazilian japanese miniature fox ratonero bodeguero andaluz rat and tenterfield 30 following s death the only people who made serious efforts to continue those strains were two men one in chislehurst with the surname of east and another in cornwall named archer east at one point had several couples all of which were descended from one of s dogs the type aimed for were not as big as the show fox and were usually less than 15 pounds 6 8 kg 3 the is a small that has its origins in fox hunting it is principally white bodied and smooth rough or broken coated but can be any colour the club was later renamed the parson club 4 badger digging required a different type of dog than fox hunting and it is likely that bull stock was introduced to strengthen the breed which may have caused the creation of a shorter legged variety of that started to appear around this period at the same time that a split was appearing between show and working fox s a further split was occurring between two different types of white both carrying s name 3 heinemann was invited to judge classes for working s at crufts with an aim to bring working s back into the show ring and influence those that disregard working qualities in dogs these classes were continued for several years by various judges but charles cruft dropped the attempt as the classes were never heavily competed following heinemann s death in 1930 the kennel and leadership of the club passed to annie harris but the club itself folded shortly before world war ii 3 4 the club of america was formed in 1976 by ailsa crawford one of the first breeders in the united states size ranges for dogs were kept broad with the ability of working dogs awarded higher than those in conformation shows an open registry was maintained with restricted line breeding registration for the club is made at adulthood for s rather than at birth to ensure the breed s qualities remain given the open registry 17 the small white fox working s we know today were first bred by the reverend john a parson and hunting enthusiast born in 1795 1 and they can trace their origin to the now extinct english white 2 difficulty in differentiating the dog from the creature it was pursuing brought about the need for a mostly white dog 3 and so in 1819 during his last year of university at exeter college oxford 4 he purchased a small white and tan female named trump from a local milkman in the nearby small hamlet of elsfield 5 or marston 6 trump epitomised his ideal fox 7 which at the time was a term used for any which was used to bolt foxes out of their burrows 2 her colouring was described as white with just a patch of dark tan over each eye and ear whilst a similar dot not larger than a penny piece marks the root of the tail 8 davies a friend of s wrote trump was such an animal as had only seen in his dreams 4 she was the basis for a breeding program to develop a with high stamina for the hunt as well as the courage and formation to chase out foxes that had gone to ground 9 by the 1850s these dogs were recognised as a distinct breed 10 due to their working nature s remain much as they were some 200 years ago 31 they are sturdy tough and tenacious measuring between 1015 inches 2538 cm at the withers 32 and weigh 1418 pounds 6 48 2 kg 16 the body length must be in proportion to the height and the dog should present a compact balanced image predominantly white in coloration more than 51 with black and or brown and or tan markings 32 they exhibit either a smooth rough or a combination of both which is known as a broken coat a broken coated dog may have longer hair on the tail or face than that which is seen on a smooth coated dog 33 the skin can sometimes show a pattern of small black or brown spots referred to as ticking that do not carry through to the outer coat 16 all coat types should be dense double coats that are neither silky in the case of smooth coats nor woolly in the case of rough coats 16 several breed clubs appeared in the united kingdom during the 1970s to promote the breed including the club of great britain jrtcgb and the south east club sejrtc the jrtcgb promoted the range of sizes that remain in its standards today whereas the sejrtc set a minimum height for dogs at 13 inches 33 cm while the jrtcgb sought to ensure that the breed s working ability remained through non recognition with other breed registries the sejrtc activity sought recognition with the uk kennel club 18 in 1983 the parson club of great britain pjrtcgb was resurrected to seek kennel club recognition for the breed although the application was initially rejected a new standard was created for the pjrtcgb based on the standard of the sejrtc and under that standard the breed was recognised by the kennel club in 1990 as the parson 19 was dropped from the official name in 1999 and the recognised name of the breed became the parson 20 the is frequently confused with the parson see the american kennel club and the which is a shorter legged stockier variety within the fédération cynologique internationale the is also known as the term is also commonly misapplied to other small white s the is a broad type with a size range of 1015 inches 2538 cm the parson is limited only to a middle range with a standard size of 1214 inches 3036 cm while the is smaller at 812 inches 2030 cm each breed has different physical proportions according to the standards of their breed clubs many breeds can claim heritage to the early fox of this period including the brazilian japanese miniature fox ratonero bodeguero andaluz rat and tenterfield 13 following world war ii the requirement for hunting dogs drastically declined and with it the numbers of s the dogs were increasingly used as family and companion dogs further crossbreeding occurred with welsh corgis chihuahuas and other smaller breeds of the offspring of these crosses became known as puddin dogs shortie s or s 16
Labrador_Retriever,the first st john s dog was said to be brought to england in or around 1820 but the breed s reputation had already spread to england there is a story that the 2nd earl of malmesbury saw a st john s dog on a fishing boat and immediately made arrangements with traders to have some of these dogs imported to england these ancestors of the first s so impressed the earl with their skill and ability for retrieving anything within the water and on shore that he devoted his entire kennel to developing and stabilizing the breed 16 the lab s coat should be short and dense but not wiry yellow and fox red several early descriptions of the st john s water dog exist in 1822 explorer w e cormack crossed the island of newfoundland by foot in his journal he wrote the dogs are admirably trained as s in fowling and are otherwise useful the smooth or short haired dog is preferred because in frosty weather the long haired kind become encumbered with ice on coming out of the water 15 the foundational breed of what is now the was known as the st john s water dog st john s dog or lesser newfoundland when the dogs were later brought to england they were named after the geographic area known as the they were known as s because they retrieved in the sea or simply to distinguish them from the larger newfoundland breed even though the breed was from the more southern avalon peninsula golden s left are often confused with yellow labs right one obvious difference is the much shorter hair of the an early report by a colonel hawker described the dog as by far the best for any kind of shooting he is generally black and no bigger than a pointer very fine in legs with short smooth hair and does not carry his tail so much curled as the other is extremely quick running swimming and fighting and their sense of smell is hardly to be credited 15 a favourite disability assistance breed in many countries s are frequently trained to aid the blind those who have autism to act as a therapy dog and perform screening and detection work for law enforcement and other official agencies 8 they are prized as sporting and hunting dogs 10 there is a great deal of variety among s the following characteristics are typical of the conformation show bred bench bred lines of this breed in the united states and are based on the american kennel club standard 22 significant differences between uk and us standards are noted the bloodlines as traced by vanderwyk each lead back to three black s in the 1880sbuccleuch avon m and his sire and dam malmesbury tramp m and malmesbury june f morningtown tobla is also named as an important intermediary and according to the studbook of buccleuch kennels the chocolates in this kennel came through ftw peter of faskally 1908 21 the breed tends to shed hair twice annually or regularly throughout the year in temperate climates 14 some s shed considerably however individual s vary 23 hair is usually short and straight and the tail is quite broad and strong the webbed toes of the make them excellent swimmers the webbing between their toes can also serve as a snowshoe in colder climates and keep snow from balling up between their toesa condition that can be painful to other breeds with hair between the toes their interwoven coat is also relatively waterproof providing more assistance for swimming interest in the darker shades of gold and fox red were re established by english breeders in the 1980s and three dogs were instrumental in this change balrion king frost black born c 1976 who consistently sired very dark yellow offspring and is credited as having the biggest influence in the re development of the fox red shade 19 and his great grandson the likewise famous wynfaul tabasco b 1986 20 described as the father of the modern fox red and the only modern fox red show champion in the uk other dogs such as red alert and scrimshaw placido flamingo are also credited with passing on the genes into more than one renowned bloodline 19 in the 1830s the 10th earl of home and his nephews the 5th duke of buccleuch and lord john scott 12 13 had imported progenitors of the breed from newfoundland to europe for use as gundogs another early advocate of these newfoundland dogs or s as they later became known was the 2nd earl of malmesbury who bred them for their expertise in waterfowling 12 13 during the 1880s the 3rd earl of malmesbury the 6th duke of buccleuch and the 12th earl of home collaborated to develop and establish the modern breed the dogs buccleuch avon and buccleuch ned given by malmesbury to buccleuch were mated with bitches carrying blood from those originally imported by the 5th duke and the 10th earl of home the offspring are considered to be the ancestors of modern s 13 14 the body should be strong and muscular with a level top line a few kennels breeding their ancestors the st john s water dog were in england at the same time a combination of the sheep protection policy in newfoundland and rabies quarantine in the united kingdom led to the gradual demise of the st john s water dog in canada 11 the progenitors of the were actually from newfoundland and exceptionally the breed known as the newfoundland was created near the same time in the two breeds names and origins were mixed once moved into england and the americas the dog from became the large long furred dog we see and know today and the dog from newfoundland became the s are a relatively large breed in his book excursions in and about newfoundland during the years 1839 and 1840 17 the geologist joseph beete jukes describes the st john s water dog a thin short haired black dog came off shore to us to day the animal was of a breed very different from what we understand by the term newfoundland dog in england he had a thin tapering snout a long thin tail and rather thin but powerful legs with a lank body  the hair short and smooth wrote jukes these are the most abundant dogs in the country they are no means handsome but are generally more intelligent and useful than the others i observed he once or twice put his foot in the water and paddled it about this foot was white and harvey said he did it to toil or entice the fish the whole proceeding struck me as remarkable more especially as they said he had never been taught anything of the kind the also is a type of gun dog 5 the is one of the most popular breeds of dog 6 in the united kingdom 7 and the united states 8 9 as with some other breeds the conformation typically show english or bench and the field typically working or american lines differ although both lines are bred in both countries in general however conformation s tend to be bred as medium sized dogs shorter and stockier with fuller faces and a slightly calmer nature than their field counterparts which are often bred as taller lighter framed dogs with slightly less broad faces and a slightly longer nose however field s should still be proportional and fit within american kennel club standards with field s excessively long noses thin heads long legs and lanky frames are not considered standard these two types are informal and not codified or standardised no distinction is made by the akc or other kennel clubs but the two types come from different breeding lines australian stock also exists though not seen in the west they are common in asia these dogs are also very good with children s are medium large with males typically weighing 6580 lb 2936 kg and females 5570 lb 2532 kg 22 the majority of the characteristics of this breed with the exception of colour are the result of breeding to produce a working the first written reference to the breed was in 1814 instructions to young sportsmen by colonel peter hawker 10 the first painting in 1823 cora a bitch by edwin landseer 10 and the first photograph in 1856 the earl of home s dog nell described both as a and a st johns dog 18 by 1870 the name became common in england 10 the first yellow on record was born in 1899 ben of hyde kennels of major c j radclyffe 10 and the breed was recognised by the kennel club in 1903 the first american kennel club akc registration was in 1917 10 the chocolate emerged in the 1930s 10 although liver spotted pups were documented being born at the buccleuch kennels in 1892 10 the first dog to appear on the cover of life magazine was a black called blind of arden in the december 12th 1938 issue the st john s dog survived until the early 1980s the last two individuals being photographed in old age around 1981 18 yellow and chocolate pups would occasionally appear although often culled until finally gaining acceptance in the 20th century citation needed the first recognized yellow was ben of hyde born in 1899 and chocolate s became more established in the 1930s citation needed there is also a significant difference between show labs which tend to be short legged and very heavy and field labs which have a

of the rump approximates the height from the highest point of the shoulders to the ground the eyes should be very dark oval in shape and have an alert and intelligent expression the ears should fold over close to the head set at or slightly below eye level the coat should be of naturally curly texture dense throughout although most akc registered show dogs have a lion cut or other similarly shaven look the sizes of the official akc recognized breeds are determined by height not by weight the has contributed to many other dog breeds such as the miniature schnauzer 11 standard schnauzer 12 and dogs of the bichon type 13 in order to either save those breeds from extinction reduce size or by dog fanciers to improve their appearance the smallest or toy variety was developed in england in the 18th century hunting and working dogs were typically of the standard variety though some reports suggest that smaller varieties such as the miniature may have been popular for truffle hunting as their feet were less likely to damage the delicate fungi 16 miniature and toy varieties tend to be bred primarily for companionship in the mid to late 19th century the trade in dyeing and affixing their fur to unusual proportions began with the need to compliment the victorian and georgian sensibilities of these women 17 to the point that their status as a dog of the middle and upper classes was quite solid by the time of the founding of the kennel club in the 1870s as they were one of the first dog breeds registered the has been bred in at least three sizes including standard miniature and toy according to the american kennel club which recognised the breed in 1887 14 the standard is the oldest of the three varieties 15 and was later bred down to the miniature and toy sizes the british kennel club also says recognises three sizes stating that the miniature and toy are scaled down versions of the standard 2 the fédération cynologique internationale fci recognizes four sizes of one breed standard medium miniature and toy s exist in many coat colors despite the standard s claim to greater age than the other varieties some evidence shows the smaller types developed only a short time after the breed assumed the general type by which it is recognized today as of july 2014 the end results of 20 years of breeding to reawaken the hunting instinct have been dogs that are very eager to please their masters it has resulted in a gun dog with extreme intelligence a relentless drive to catch its quarry and strong swimming skills that requires special training their aptitude is second only to the british border collie 4 and thus the hunting standard requires the gunman to be quite specific as to what he wants and how he wants it done unlike other spaniels and retrievers standard s will attempt to solve a problem independently and need to be told specifically what is wanted when tracking and retrieving a bird because they are highly intelligent harsh training methods do not work with this dog breed in the field corrections must be timely given with precision and the trainer must have a firm but kind hand an overbearing owner training his dog to hunt will find his standard fearful of his master and the entire experience and refusing to budge an inch towards the water or into the brush 21 traditionally the standard the largest of the breed was a retriever or gun dog used in particular for duck hunting and sometimes upland bird hunting the breed has been used for fowl hunting in us and canada since the early 1990s in and out of hunting tests the modern standard retains many of the traits prized by their original owners a keen working intelligence that makes the dog easy to command webbed feet that make it an agile swimmer all of the s ancestors and descendants had or share the love of water athletic stamina and a moisture resistant curly coat that acts like a wool jumper in damp conditions towards the second half of the nineteenth century their use in hunting declined in favour of their use in circuses and status symbols of the wealthy so that by the 20th century they were only found as companions or circus dogs 18 however in the past 20 years some breeders in the united states and canada have been selecting for dogs with drive for birds in order to revive the breed for hunting with some success 19 the canadian kennel club admitted the standard for hunting trials in 1996 and the american kennel club in 1998 respectively 20 some sources believe the show clips evolved from working clips which originally provided warmth to major joints when the dogs were immersed in cold water the rest of the body is shaved for less drag in the water others express skepticism at this theory instead citing the french circus as the origin of the entertaining and unique clips citation needed the european mainland had known the long before it was brought to england drawings by german artist albrecht dürer established the popular image of

coated with clearly defined rich tan markings whose powerful appearance does not lack nobility and which is exceptionally well suited to being a companion service and working dog 3 this breed is all about balance endurance proportionality intelligence and strength the various standards in place for the s physical appearance specify these characteristics the coat consists of an outer coat and an undercoat the outer coat is of medium length coarse dense and flat the undercoat should be present on the neck and thighs the undercoat must not show through the outer coat s living in hot climates may have acclimatised and may be missing the undercoat coats tend to be low maintenance although they experience heavy shedding before their seasons females or seasonally males according to american kennel club breed standards a s coat is short and straight a coat that is long or wavy is considered a flaw to the akc 16 a town in this region was eventually given the name rottweil 10 it became an important trade center and the descendants of the roman cattle dogs proved their worth by driving the cattle to market and protecting the cattle from robbers and wild animals 10 the dogs are said to have been used by traveling butchers at markets during the middle ages to guard money pouches tied around their necks 11 the dogs eventually came to be called metzgerhunds or butcher dogs 10 as railroads became the primary method for moving stock to market the need for the breed declined as did the number of s the number of s diminished so severely that by 1882 in a dog show in heilbronn there was only one very poor representative of the breed 10 when seen from behind the rear legs are straight and not too close together when standing free obtuse angles are formed between the dog s upper thigh and the hip bone the upper thigh and the lower thigh and the lower thigh and metatarsal the upper thigh is moderately long broad and strongly muscled the lower thigh is long strongly and broadly muscled sinewy the hocks are sturdy well angulated not steep the hind feet are slightly longer than the front feet toes are strong arched as tight as the front feet the uk r tva l or r twa l us r twa l r 1 2 is a breed of domestic dog regarded as medium to large 3 4 or large 5 6 the dogs were known in german as metzgerhund meaning rottweil butchers dogs because one of their uses was to herd livestock and pull carts laden with butchered meat to market 3 this continued until the mid 19th century when railways caused droving to be replaced with herding s are now used as search and rescue dogs as guide dogs for the blind as guard dogs and police dogs 7 in 1931 the was officially recognised by the american kennel club 13 in 1936 s were exhibited in britain at crufts in 1966 a separate register was opened for the breed in fact in the mid 1990s the popularity of the reached an all time high with it being the most registered dog by the american kennel club 14 in 2013 the american kennel club ranked the as the 9th most popular purebreed in the united states 15 the traditional gait of a is a trot therefore the is a trotter trotting in this breed is by no means a fault and is required this movement comes naturally to the and should appear as such any deviation may lead to a disqualification in the show ring while walking the s legs both front and hind should move in a straight forward and backward manner as with the straight movement of the legs the path the moves in should also be straight the s gait is all about balance and effectiveness as the breed is still used as a herder today 16 the buildup to world war i saw a great demand for police dogs and that led to a revival of interest in the during the first and second world wars s were put into service in various roles including as messenger ambulance draught and guard dogs the color and markings of a are very distinctive a is always by any breed club standards black with well defined mahogany or rust colored markings that do not take up more than ten percent of the dog s body color all s standard to akc specifications have one mahogany dot above each eye on the inner brow ridge on the cheeks one strip on each side of the snout cheek markings do not cross over the bridge of the nose the top of the nose should remain black the markings on the face should move down onto the dog s throat on the chest a will have two downward facing triangular marks on each front leg the marks will stretch from the forearm to the toes on the hind legs the markings will begin on the inside and move outward onto the stifle then out onto the hock stretching to the toes as well akc standards recognize that the black base color is not completely voided on the rear pasterns there is a patch of rust or mahogany underneath the tail that resembles a triangle as well a thin strip of black should be present on each of the s toes 16 the back is straight strong and firm the loins are short strong and deep the croup is broad of medium length and slightly rounded neither flat nor falling away the chest is roomy broad and deep approximately 50 of the shoulder height with a well developed forechest and well sprung ribs the flanks are not tucked up the various german clubs amalgamated to form the allgemeiner deutscher klub adrk general german club in 1921 this was officially recorded in the register of clubs and associations at the district court of stuttgart on 27 january 1924 12 the adrk is recognised worldwide as the home club of the the is one of the oldest of herding breeds 8 with a history possibly dating back to the roman empire 9 the may be a descendant of ancient roman drover dogs a mastiff type dog that was a dependable rugged dog with great intelligence and guarding instincts during their quest to conquer europe the roman legions traveled in large numbers across the continent the non existence of refrigeration meant the soldiers had to bring herds of cattle for food the drover dogs were used to keep the herds of cattle together and to guard the herds at night around a d 74 the roman army travelled across the alps and into what is now southern germany for the next two centuries the roman drover dogs were continually used in herding and driving cattle for trade even after the romans were driven out of the area by the swabians 10 the tail was traditionally docked at the first or second joint or natural bob tail stumpy however docking is now banned in many countries and this is reflected in the fci standard it remains legal in others notably the usa and new zealand and this is reflected in the akc and nzkc standards when seen from the front the front legs are straight and not placed close to each other the forearm seen from the side stands straight and vertical the slope of the shoulder blade is about 45 degrees the shoulders are well laid back the upper arm is close fitting to the body the forearm is strongly developed and muscular pasterns are

Saint_Bernard,the st or st b rn rd or b r n rd 2 is a breed of very large working dog from the western alps in france switzerland and italy they were originally bred at the great and little st pass 3 for rescue the breed has become famous through tales of alpine rescues as well as for its enormous size the russian army kennels crossbreed st s with caucasian ovcharka to produce the moscow watchdogs that are still used as military service dogs in russia today 16 st s have in common many characteristics of other mountain dog breeds longhaired st s the name st originates from the great and little st hospice two traveler s hospices on the often treacherous great and little st passes in the western alps between switzerland and italy pennine alps and between france and italy in the graian alps south of the former one and few miles away from the mont blanc the passes the lodges and the dogs are named for of menthon the 11th century monk who established the stations 14 st wasn t in widespread use until the middle of the 19th century the dogs were called dogs noble steeds alpenmastiff or barry dogs before that time a st with short coat the earliest written records of the st breed are from monks at the hospice at the great st pass in 1707 with paintings and drawings of the dog dating even earlier 6 the most famous st to save people at the pass was barry sometimes spelled berry who reportedly saved somewhere between 40 and 100 lives there is a monument to barry in the cimetière des chiens and his body was preserved in the natural history museum in berne 7 another famous dog was rutor the faithful companion of the priest fr pierre chanoux named after the peak tête du rutor located above the little st pass the classic st looked very different from the st of today because of cross breeding severe winters from 1816 to 1818 led to increased numbers of avalanches killing many of the dogs used for breeding while they were performing rescues 8 9 in an attempt to preserve the breed the remaining st s were crossed with newfoundlands brought from the colony of newfoundland in the 1850s and so lost much of their use as rescue dogs in the snowy climate of the alps because the long fur they inherited would freeze and weigh them down 10 the st is a giant dog with the largest individuals reaching over 167 kg 367 lb the average weight of the breed is between 65 and 120 kg 140 and 260 lb or more and the approximate height at the withers is 70 to 90 cm 28 to 35 in 4 an open stud book would have allowed breeders to correct such errors by breeding in working dog of other dog breeds eyes are usually brown but sometimes can be icy blue and should have naturally tight lids with haws only slightly visible the breed is strikingly similar to the english mastiff with which it shares a common ancestor known as the alpine mastiff the modern st breed is radically different than the original dogs kept at the st hospice most notably by being much larger in size and build since the late 1800s the st breed has been ever refined and improved using many different large molosser breeds including the newfoundland great pyrenees greater swiss mountain dog bernese mountain dog great dane english mastiff and possibly the tibetan mastiff and caucasian ovcharka other breeds such as the rottweiler boxer and english bulldog may have contributed to the st s bloodline as well it is suspected that many of these large breeds were used to redevelop each other to combat the threat of their extinction after world war ii which may explain why all of them played a part in the creation of the st as seen today 15 the ancestors of the st share a history with the sennenhunds the st also called alpine mountain dogs or alpine cattle dogs are the large farm dogs of the farmers and dairymen of most notably the french alps livestock guardians herding dogs and draft dogs as well as hunting dogs search and rescue dogs and watchdogs these dogs are thought to be descendants of molosser type dogs brought into the alps by the ancient romans and the st is recognized internationally today as one of the molossoid breeds 5 the coat can be either smooth or rough the smooth coat being close and flat while the rough is dense flat and more profuse around the neck and legs the colour is typically a red shade with white or a mahogany brindle with white black shading is usually found on the face and ears the swiss st club was founded in basel on 15 march 1884 the st was the very first breed entered into the swiss stud book in 1884 and the breed standard was finally approved in 1888 since then the breed has been a swiss national dog 6 the dogs at the st hospice were working dogs that were smaller than today s show st s dogs originally about the size of a german shepherd dog 12 the st grew to the size of today s dog as kennel clubs and dog shows emphasized appearance over the dog s working ability along with a closed stud book 13 st dog in winter the tail is long and heavy hanging low the four sennenhund breeds the grosser schweizer sennenhund greater swiss mountain dog the berner sennenhund bernese mountain dog the appenzeller sennenhund appenzeller and the entlebucher sennenhund entlebucher mountain dog are similar in appearance and share the same location and history but are tricolor rather than red and white the dogs never received any special training from the monks instead younger dogs would learn how to perform search and rescue operations from older dogs 11
Schnauzer,a na z r german na ts plural lit translation snouter is a dog breed that originated in germany in the 15th and 16th centuries 1 the term comes from the german word for snout and means colloquially moustache 2 because of the dog s distinctively bearded snout 3 although the is considered a terrier type dog they do not have the typical terrier temperament there are three breeds the giant the standard and the miniature toy and teacup are not breeds of but these common terms are used to market undersized or ill bred miniature s citation needed the original was of the same size as the modern standard breed and was bred as a rat catcher yard dog and guard dog the miniature and the giant were developed from the standard and are the result of outcrosses with other breeds exhibiting the desirable characteristics needed for the s original purpose standard s are around 1 5 ft 46 cm tall at the shoulder and weigh 30 to 45 lb 14 to 20 kg they are in the group of working dogs standard s have been used to catch rats and other rodents and as guard dogs they have also carried messages in times of war helped the red cross and been police dogs miniature s are around 1 ft 30 cm tall at the shoulder and weigh between 14 and 20 lb 6 4 and 9 1 kg 4 they have high energy levels and are very intelligent dogs the american kennel club akc approves salt and pepper black and black and silver as acceptable coat colors for a miniature they are often bred in pure white or even parti multi colored but neither are approved by the akc 5 6 the miniature is more delicate and less robust than his cousins and should not live outside they make excellent pets as they are loyal companions and are rarely aggressive toward strangers although they are quick to sound the alarm at a perceived threat the miniature is the result of crossing the original with breeds including the poodle and the affenpinscher
Shetland_Sheepdog,the year 1909 marked the initial recognition of the sheltie by the english kennel club with the first registered sheltie being a female called badenock rose the first sheltie to be registered by the american kennel club was lord scott in 1911 8 shelties have a double coat and often shed a lot of the time no matter the season the topcoat consists of long straight water repellent hair which provides protection from cold and the elements the undercoat is short furry and very dense and helps to keep the dog warm mats can be commonly found behind the ears under the elbow on each front leg and in the fluffy fur on the hind legs the skirts as well as around the collar if worn the coat is usually shed twice a year often at spring and autumn 15 females will also shed right before or right after giving birth male shelties technically shed less than females but fur still comes off constantly 16 shaving these dogs is very bad for their skin and some do not regrow any significant amount of hair after being shaved a condition known as alopecia 17 spaying or neutering can alter coat texture making it softer more prone to matting and even more profuse citation needed it should be noted that shelties shed in clumps which can be pulled or brushed out of the main coat rather than individual hair this makes them much easier to groom and clean up after than many smooth haired dogs which leave loose fur in their space when the breed was originally introduced breeders called them collies which upset rough collie breeders so the name was changed to 2 7 during the early 20th century up until the 1940s additional crosses were made to rough collies to help retain the desired rough collie type  in fact the first akc sheltie champion s dam was a purebred rough collie citation needed there have been reports of a brindle sheltie 13 but many sheltie enthusiasts agree that a cross sometime in the ancestry of that specific sheltie could have produced a brindle unacceptable colors in the show ring are a rustiness in a blue or black coat colors may not be faded no conspicuous white spots and the color cannot be over 50 white unlike many miniature breeds that resemble their larger counterparts this breed was not developed simply by selectively breeding the rough collie for smaller and smaller size the original of was a spitz type dog probably similar to the modern icelandic this dog was crossed with mainland working collies brought to the islands 6 and then after being brought to england it was further extensively crossed with the rough collie and other breeds including some or all of the extinct greenland yakki the king charles spaniel not the cavalier the pomeranian 2 and possibly the border collie the original spitz type working of is now extinct having been replaced for herding there by the border collie the in its modern form has never been used as a working dog on and ironically it is uncommon there citation needed the s early history is not well known although of obscure origin what is known is that the sheltie is not a direct descendant of the collie the sheltie is a descendant of small specimens of the scottish collie and the king charles spaniel it was developed to tend the diminutive sheep of the islands whose rugged stormy shores have produced other small statured animals such as the pony today it is raised as a farm dog and family pet 4 they were originally a small mixed breed dog often only about 8 inches to 12 inches in height at the shoulder and it is thought that the original herding dogs were of the spitz type and were crossed with collies from mainland britain 2 in the early 20th century james loggie added a small rough collie to the breeding stock and helped establish what would become the modern 5 shelties have a double coat which means that they have two layers of fur that make up their coat the long rough guard hairs lie on top of a thick soft undercoat the guard hairs are water repellent while the undercoat provides relief from both high and low temperatures dermatomyositis may occur at the age of 4 to 6 months and is frequently misdiagnosed by general practice veterinarians as sarcoptic or demodectic mange the disease manifests itself as alopecia on the top of the head supra and suborbital area and forearms as well as the tip of the tail if the disease progresses to its more damaging form it could affect the autonomic nervous system and the dog may have to be euthanised this disease is generation skipping and genetically transmitted with breeders having no clear methodology for screening except clear bloodline records deep tissue biopsies are required to definitively diagnose dermatomyositis 20 lay assessment of end stage dermatomyositis is observed difficulty or inability to swallow even water at this point the dog must be euthanised double merles a product of breeding two merle shelties together have a very high incidence of deafness and or blindness 12 shelties have a high level of intelligence according to dr stanley coren an expert on animal intelligence the is one of the brightest dogs ranking 6th out of 132 breeds tested his research found that an average sheltie could understand a new command in less than 5 repetitions and would obey a command the first time it was given 95 of the time or better 18 the english kennel club describes three different colors tricolour blue merle and sable ranging from golden through mahogany marked with varying amounts of white and or tan 9 essentially however a blue merle dog is a genetically black dog either black white and tan tricolor in the show ring blue merles may have blue eyes all other colors must have brown eyes white factoring affects the amount of white on the dog 11 it is hard to tell without actually breeding whether a dog is white factored or not though dogs with white going up the stifle the front of the hind leg are usually assumed to be white factored breeding two white factored dogs can result in color headed whitesshelties with colored heads sable tricolor bi black or blue or sable merle and white bodies 11 for show dogs dogs with more than 50 white are heavily penalized and thus are not shown in the breed ring they are normal in every other way the general appearance of the sheltie is that of a miniature rough collie they are a small double coated working dog agile and sturdy blue merle shelties may have blue eyes or one brown and one blue eye but all others have dark colored eyes their expression should be that of alertness with a gentle and sometimes reserved nature they are often very good with children they carry their tail down low only lifted when alert and never carried over the back they are an intensely loyal breed sometimes reserved with strangers but should not be shy or showing timidness as per the akc breed standard the also known as the sheltie is a breed of herding dog the original name of this breed was collie but this caused controversy among the rough collie breeders at the time so the breed s name was formally changed to 2 this small dog is intelligent vocal excitable energetic and willing to please and work hard the breed was formally recognized by the kennel club in 1909 3 shelties normally weigh around 511 kilograms 1124 lb citation needed in general males are taller and heavier than females accepted height ranges may differ depending on country and standard used in the usa and canada breed standards state that males and females can be between 3341 centimetres 1316 in all other standards australia new zealand and u k specify males 37 cm ± 2½ cm females 35 5 cm ± 2½ cm except f c i which specifies females 36 cm ± 2½ cm at the shoulder withers however some shelties can be found outside of these ranges but are not considered truly representative of the breed variation can be found within litters and height in the 4050 cm range is above the breed standard in some lines compared to other dogs s have a four fold increased risk of developing transitional cell carcinoma a cancer of the bladder 19 for the most part shelties are athletic and healthy like the rough collie there is a tendency toward inherited malformation and disease of the eyes each individual puppy should have his her eyes examined by a qualified veterinary ophthalmologist some lines may be susceptible to hypothyroidism epilepsy hip dysplasia or skin allergies any of the above colors may also have a color modification gene the color modification genes are merling and white factoring merling dilutes the base color sable tricolor or bi black causing a black dog s coat to show a mix of black white and gray hairs often with black patches to conform to the breed standards the shelties ears should bend slightly or tip this contributes to the proper sheltie expression citation needed the ear is to have the top third to a quarter of the ear tipped if a dog s ears are not bent referred to as prick ears some owners brace them into the correct position for several weeks to several months 14 wide set too much distance between ears are also not a desired trait nor are ears which tip too low down referred to as hound ears
Shiba_Inu,is the japanese word for dog but the origin of the prefix is less clear the word means brushwood in japanese and refers to a type of tree or shrub whose leaves turn red in the fall 6 this leads some to believe that the was named with this in mind either because the dogs were used to hunt in wild shrubs or because the most common color of the is a red color similar to that of the shrubs however in an old nagano dialect the word also had the meaning of small thus this might be a reference to the dog s dimtive stature 6 therefore the is sometimes translated as little brushwood dog 1 a small agile dog that copes very well with mountainous terrain the was originally bred for hunting 1 2 it looks similar to and is often mistaken for other japanese dog breeds like the akita or hokkaido but the is a different breed with a distinct blood line temperament and smaller size than other japanese dog breeds 3 4 5 the is the smallest of the six original and distinct spitz breeds of dog from japan 1 the is a relatively fastidious breed and feels the need to maintain itself in a clean state they can often be seen licking their paws and legs much like a cat they generally go out of their way to keep their coats clean because of their fastidious and proud nature puppies are easy to housebreak and in many cases will housebreak themselves having their owner simply place them outside after meal times and naps is generally enough to teach the the appropriate method of toileting 11 from the japanese breed standard the urajiro cream to white ventral color is required in the following areas on all coat colors on the sides of the muzzle on the cheeks inside the ears on the underjaw and upper throat inside of legs on the abdomen around the vent and the ventral side of the tail on reds commonly on the throat forechest and chest on blacks and sesames commonly as a triangular mark on both sides of the forechest 9 the is double coated with the outer coat being stiff and straight and the undercoat soft and thick fur is short and even on the fox like face ears and legs guard hairs stand off the body and are about 4 to 5 cm 1 1 2 to 2 in long at the withers tail hair is slightly longer and stands open in a brush s may be red black and tan or sesame red with black tipped hairs 7 with a cream buff or grey undercoat they may also be white cream though this color is considered a major fault by the american kennel club and should never be intentionally bred in a show dog as the required markings known as urajiro are not visible urajiro literally translates to underside white 2 conversely a white cream coat is perfectly acceptable according to the british kennel club breed standard 8 s tend to exhibit an independent nature 7 and sometimes show dog aggression this is more prevalent between female s and is influenced by the breed s strong prey drive the is best in a home without other small dogs or young children but consistent obedience training and early socialization can make all the difference the breed also interacts fairly well with cats 2 the terms spirited boldness kan i good nature ry sei and artlessness soboku have subtle interpretations that have been the subject of much commentary 10 a spirited boldness a good nature and an unaffected forthrightness which together yield dignity and natural beauty the has an independent nature and can be reserved toward strangers but is loyal and affectionate to those who earn his respect they can be aggressive toward other dogs the s frame is compact with well developed muscles 7 males are 35 to 43 cm 14 to 17 in at the withers females are 33 to 41 cm 13 to 16 in the preferred size is the middle of the range for each sex average weight at preferred size is approximately 10 kg 22 lb for males 8 kg 18 lb for females bone is moderate
Shih_Tzu,a english i tsu chinese pinyin x sh qu n also known as the chrysanthemum dog is a toy dog breed weighing 1019 pounds 4 58 6kg when fully grown the exact origins of the breed are unknown but it is thought to have originated in tibet and then been developed in china the breed is now recognized by all of the major kennel clubs in the english speaking world 1 it is also recognized by the fédération cynologique internationale for international competition in companion and toy dog group section 5 tibetan breeds 1 in the united states the ranked the 15th most popular breed in 2013 falling slightly in popularity since 2012 when it was placed in 11th position 16 although an individual s temperament varies from dog to dog the breed has a personality and temperament that is loyal affectionate outgoing and alert training and proper socializing must start at a young age for the to obey basic commands for the is prone to stubbornness when it comes to training while the is an excellent watch dog because of its alert and active nature it was not specifically bred for this purpose unlike the lhasa apso which was bred to be a sentinel dog that enjoys high perches and is wary of strangers the prefers to be close to its companions and will often offer strangers its affection because of its friendly nature the tends to interact well with other dogs and with children and adults citation needed composer james mumsford described the as a dash of lion several teaspoons of rabbit a couple of ounces of domestic cat one part court jester a dash of ballerina a pinch of old man a bit of beggar a tablespoon of monkey one part baby seal and a dash of teddy bear 4 the comes in a range of colours that include various shades of gold white brown and black other colours include black mask gold black and white solid black solid liver liver and white brindle white red and white and grey and white 5 thus when two mate there is a possibility that their offspring s coat will be similar to the sire s color dam s color tricolor or a mix of both parents color in one classification an interesting point and often a point of confusion is that while the coat color of those with black pigmented skin nose lips pads also referred to as leather is determined by the color of the coat itself the coat color on dogs with either liver or blue pigment is categorized by the color of the pigment thus a parti colored white and another shade with blue pigment is a blue and white regardless of the tint of the hair which might very well appear similar to a gold and white or other colors the same principle applies to solid blue silver and silver and white sometimes you might see dark brown pigments near the shoulders and between the armpits the uk kennel club survey puts the median life span of a at 13 years and 2 months with most living 1016 years 22 in 1934 the club of england was founded 17 and the breed was officially recognised by the kennel club uk on may 7th 1940 18 when it became eligible for challenge certificates none were awarded until 1949 the name comes from the chinese language word for lion because this kind of dog was bred to resemble the lion as depicted in traditional oriental art 8 the pekingese breed is also called lion dog in chinese is the wade giles romanization of the chinese characters meaning lion this romanization scheme was in use when the breed was first introduced in america in contemporary china pinyin is the predominant system of romanization which renders it as sh zi the mandarin chinese pronunciation is approximately shirr dz though the wade giles system is often regarded as less intuitive is a useful linguistic example of both of two cases where the wade giles scheme reflects the use of a syllabic fricative after a corresponding consonant cluster retroflexes and sibilants in modern mandarin this is a unique phonological feature that does not appear in any other known modern language in their standardized form indeed though the exact classification is still debated and dialectal variants exist linguists generally agree that these sounds cannot be represented by conventional symbols in the ipa hence why an unorthodox approximation shirr was used earlier in this paragraph however the use of a syllabic fricative is often observed in informal english with the paralinguistic expression shh which may serve as a guide to the pronunciation of a number of health issues some of them hereditary have been found in individual and are listed below the typical fine straight and silky coat has also been listed by many popular dog information websites as being hypoallergenic in comparison with many other breeds do not shed to the same degree only losing small amounts when bathed or brushed it is the dog s dander and saliva that trigger most allergic reactions allergists do recognize that at times a particular allergy patient will be able to tolerate a particular dog but they agree that the luck of the few with their pets cannot be stretched to fit all allergic people and entire breeds of dogs the coat is said to fall out only when brushed or broken or just said to shed 6 the coat may also be wavy or coarse 7 in modern chinese language the is generally known as the xi shi dog xi shi was regarded as one of the most beautiful women of ancient china the alternative name was adopted to avoid the confusion that stems from referring to the breed as a lion 9 were nicknamed the chrysanthemum dog in england in the 1930s 10 the dog may also be called the tibetan lion dog but whether the breed should be referred to as tibetan or chinese is a source of both historical and political contention as the subsequent section notes a book on the breed states that dog historians tend to have very strong opinions on the subject 11 dna analysis placed the ancestors of today s breed in the group of ancient breeds indicating close genetic relationship to wolves 12 another branch coming down from the kitchen midden dog gave rise to the papillon and long haired chihuahua and yet another kitchen midden dog branch to the pug and it is also said that the breed originated in china hence the name lion dog in 800 b c there are various theories of the origins of today s breed theories relate that it stemmed from a cross between the pekingese and lhasa apso 13 a tibetan dog gifted by the dalai lama to chinese emperors near the end of the 17th century 14 dogs during ancient times were selectively bred and seen in chinese paintings the dogs were favorites of the chinese royals and so prized that for years the chinese refused to sell trade or give any away the first dogs of the breed were imported into europe england and norway in 1930 and were classified by the kennel club as apsos 13 the first european standard for the breed was written in england in 1935 by the club 15 and the dogs were recategorised as the breed spread throughout europe and was brought to the united states after world war ii when returning members of the u s military brought back dogs from europe in the mid 1950s the was recognized by the american kennel club in 1969 in the toy group 13 have a number of respiratory problems related to the shape of their face and head brachycephalic syndrome is a common problem and mostly affects dogs with short noses brachycephalic breeds an obstruction in the upper airways causes the dog to have laboured breathing not every brachycephalic dog will develop respiratory problems but most will to some degree severe problems may require surgery hypothyroidism occurs when the thyroid gland malfunctions and stops producing a hormone responsible for proper metabolism this malfunction is commonly attributed to immune system problems it usually affects middle aged dogs and is seen in all breeds symptoms include hair loss weight gain muscle loss and lethargy this disease is usually diagnosed through blood tests it can be effectively treated with drug therapy the may be more prone than other breeds to get a blood disease called immune mediated hemolytic anemia which causes their immune system to attack itself and kill off their blood cells this can be found through blood tests but among the signs are yellowing of the skin gums tiredness loss of appetite and loss of balance that occurs over two days 21 some health issues in the breed are portosystemic shunt of the liver and hip dysplasia in standard sizes there have been cases of being epileptic which in turn may lead to shortening of the life span of the if untreated many dogs are also prone to ear infections 20 the is a sturdy little dog with a short muzzle and large dark eyes they have a soft and long double coat a should stand no more than 28 cm 11 in at the withers and with an ideal weight of 4 5 to 8 6 kg 10 to 19 lbs drop ears are covered with long fur and the heavily furred tail is carried curled over the back the coat may be of any color though white and with blazes of grey are frequently seen the is slightly longer than tall and bigger dogs ideally should carry themselves with distinctly arrogant carriage a very noticeable feature is the underbite which is required in the breed standard 1 the traditional long silky coat which reaches the floor requires daily brushing to avoid tangles because of their long coat and fast growing hair regular grooming is necessary which may be expensive and should be taken into account when considering adopting one of this breed often the coat is clipped short to simplify care for conformation showing the coat must be left in its natural state though trimming for neatness around the feet and anus is allowed the shorter cut is typically called a puppy cut 2 or a teddy bear cut when the puppy cut is accompanied by a fuller rounder face resembling a stuffed animal 3 it is very common for s to develop eye problems at any age and even more so once they are older most veterinarians will recommend eye drops to assist with any eye irritations some dogs have allergies which causes excess discharge around the eye older s are known to develop cataracts which can be corrected with surgery if not treated the dog may become blind in the eye that has the cataract the distinctive large eyes can easily be scratched which may cause an ulcer the dog will normally have the injured eye closed or half closed and may have excessive tears 19 intervertebral disk disease in the dog is a common chondrodystrophic disorder manifested by acute back pain loss of coordination paresis and loss of the ability to feel deep pain sensations ivdd commonly occurs in certain toy breeds such as dachshund pekingese french bulldog beagle basset hound american cocker spaniel lhasa apso and welsh corgi
Siberian_Husky,huskies come in a variety of colors and patterns usually with white paws and legs facial markings and tail tip the most common coats are black and white then less common copper red and white grey and white pure white and the rare agouti coat though many individuals have blondish or piebald spotting striking masks spectacles and other facial markings occur in wide variety merle coat patterns are not allowed the american kennel club allows all coat colors from black to pure white 2 the first dogs arrived in the americas 12 000 years ago however people and their dogs did not settle in the arctic until the paleo eskimo people 4 500 years ago and then the thule people 1 000 years ago both originating from siberia 5 the was originally developed by the chukchi people of the chukchi peninsula in eastern siberia 6 they were brought to nome alaska in 1908 for sled dog racing 5 the original huskies were bred by the chukchi people  whose hunter gatherer culture relied on their help it is an active energetic resilient breed whose ancestors lived in the extremely cold and harsh environment of the arctic william goosak a russian fur trader introduced them to nome alaska during the nome gold rush initially as sled dogs the people of nome referred to the huskies as rats due to size and weighing 40 to 50 pounds when compared to the malamute dogs 4 because the had been raised in a family setting by the chukchi and not left to fend for themselves they could be trusted with children 16 the aspca classifies the breed as good with children it also states they exhibit high energy indoors have special exercise needs and may be destructive without proper care 1 in 1989 a study was made of ancient canid remains dated to the late pleistocene and early holocene that had been uncovered by miners decades earlier around fairbanks alaska these were identified as canis lupus and described as short faced wolves the collection was separated into those specimens that looked more wolf like i e the beringian wolf and those that looked more dog like and in comparison to the skulls of eskimo dogs from both greenland and siberia thought to be their forerunners 7 the american kennel club describes the s eyes as an almond shape moderately spaced and set slightly obliquely the akc breed standard is that eyes may be brown or blue one of each or particoloured are acceptable complete is heterochromia these eye color combinations are considered acceptable by the american kennel club 11 the parti color does not affect the vision of the dog show quality dogs are preferred to have neither pointed nor square noses the nose is black in gray dogs tan in black dogs liver in copper colored dogs and may be light tan in white dogs in some instances huskies can exhibit what is called snow nose or winter nose this condition is called hypopigmentation in animals snow nose is acceptable in the show ring 10 12 tails are heavily furred these dogs will often curl up with their tails over their faces and noses in order to provide additional warmth as pictured when curled up to sleep the will cover its nose for warmth often referred to as the swirl the tail should be expressive held low when the dog is relaxed and curved upward in a sickle shape when excited or interested in something it should be symmetrical and not curved or deviated to the side the tail can curl enough to touch the back 10 the russian is a medium size working dog breed that originated in north eastern siberia russia 2 the breed belongs to the spitz genetic family 3 it is recognizable by its thickly furred double coat erect triangular ears and distinctive markings in 2015 a study using a number of genetic markers indicated that the the alaskan malamute and the alaskan share a close genetic relationship between each other and were related to chukotka sled dogs from siberia they were separate to the two inuit dogs the canadian eskimo dog and the greenland dog in north america the and the malamute both had maintained their lineage and had contributed significantly to the alaskan which showed evidence of crossing with european breeds that was consistent with this breed being created in post colonial north america 5 the howls rather than barks 13 they have been described as escape artists which can include digging under chewing through or even jumping over fences 1 14 15 the breed standard indicates that the males of the breed are ideally between 21 and 24 inches 53 and 61 cm tall at the withers and weighing between 45 and 60 pounds 20 and 27 kg females are smaller growing to between 20 to 22 inches 51 to 56 cm tall at the withers and weighing between 35 to 50 pounds 16 to 23 kg 10 a s coat is thicker than that of most other dog breeds 10 comprising two layers a dense undercoat and a longer topcoat of short straight guard hairs 2 it protects the dogs effectively against harsh arctic winters but the coat also reflects heat in the summer it is able to withstand temperatures as low as 50 to 60 °c 58 to 76 °f the undercoat is often absent during shedding their thick coats require weekly grooming 10 nearly all dog breeds genetic closeness to the gray wolf is due to admixture 8 however several arctic dog breeds show a genetic closeness with the now extinct taymyr wolf of north asia due to admixture these breeds are associated with high latitudes the and greenland dog that are also associated with arctic human populations and to a lesser extent the shar pei and finnish spitz an admixture graph of the greenland dog indicates a best fit of 3 5 shared material however an ancestry proportion ranging between 1 4 and 27 3 is consistent with the data this indicates admixture between the taymyr wolf population and the ancestral dog population of these 4 high latitude breeds this introgression could have provided early dogs living in high latitudes with phenotypic variation beneficial for adaption to a new and challenging environment it also indicates the ancestry of present day dog breeds descends from more than one region 9
West_Highland_White_Terrier,the commonly known as the ie or y is a breed of dog from scotland with a distinctive fluffy coat the modern breed is descended from a number of breeding programs of s in scotland before the 20th century edward donald malcolm 16th laird of poltalloch is credited with the creation of the modern breed from his poltalloch but did not want to be known as such the breed is prone to skin disorders 2 about a quarter of ies surveyed are affected by atopic dermatitis a heritable chronic allergic skin condition a higher proportion of males are affected compared to females 14 an uncommon but severe breed specific skin condition hyperplastic dermatosis may affect s both juveniles and adults dogs affected dogs can suffer from red hyperpigmentation lichenification and hair loss in the initial stages this condition can be misdiagnosed as allergies or less serious forms of dermatitis 15 the breed is predisposed to conditions found in many breeds such as abdominal hernias 12 ie puppies may be affected by craniomandibular osteopathy a disease also known as lion jaw and is sometimes also referred to as ie jaw the disease is an autosomal recessive condition so a puppy can only be affected by it if both its parents are carriers of the faulty gene the condition appears across many breeds including several different types of s as well as other unrelated breeds such as the great dane it typically appears in dogs under a year old and can cause problems for the dog to chew or swallow food radiographic testing can be conducted to diagnose the condition in which the bones around the jaw thicken additionally the blood may show increased calcium levels and enzyme levels the condition often stops progressing by the time the dog is a year old and in some cases can recede it is normally treated with anti inflammatory medications and the feeding of soft foods in some cases tube feeding may be necessary however if the animal still cannot eat and is in uncontrolled pain then euthanasia may be the only medical option remaining 13 the breed remains very popular in the uk twice winner at cruft s and is in the top third of all breeds in the us since the 1960s it has been featured in television and film including in hamish macbeth and in advertising by companies such as cesar dog food and scottish whisky black it is a medium sized although with longer legs than other scottish breeds of it has a double coat of fur which fills out the dog s face giving it a rounded appearance the breed can be good with children but does not always tolerate rough handling the ie is an active and intelligent breed and is social with a high prey drive as they were once used to hunt rodents several breed specific and nonspecific health issues appear in the breed including a condition in young dogs nicknamed ie jaw which causes an overgrowth of bone in the jaw of the dog it can also be prone to skin disorders with a breed specific condition called hyperplastic dermatosis occurring they are very energetic and need plenty of exercise cousin to the cairn the ie was bred to hunt small rodents at places such as farms they have a soft dense thick undercoat and a rough outer coat 1 which can grow to about 2 inches 5 1 cm long 2 the fur fills out the face to give a rounded appearance 1 as puppies develop into adults their coarse outer coat is normally removed by either hand stripping especially for dog showing or otherwise clipping 1 the temperament of the can vary greatly with some being friendly towards children whilst others prefer solitude 4 it will not tolerate rough handling such as a child pulling on its ears and can be both food and toy possessive 5 it is normally independent assured and self confident and can make a good watchdog it is a loyal breed that bonds with its owner but is often always on the move requiring good exercise 1530 min the ie is highly social and is the most friendly and jolly of all the scottish breeds of s 6 commonly ies have bright deep set almond shaped eyes that are dark in colour their ears are pointed and erect 1 members of the breed typically weigh between 15 and 20 pounds 6 8 and 9 1 kg and the average height is between 1011 inches 2528 cm at the withers 1 the body should be shorter than the height of the dog at the shoulder 1 they also have a deep chest muscular limbs a black nose and a short closely fitted jaw with scissors bite lower canines locked in front of upper canines upper incisors locked over lower incisors 2 the ie s paws are slightly turned out to give it better grip than flat footed breeds when it climbs on rocky surfaces 3 in young puppies the nose and footpads have pink markings which slowly turn black as they age 2 it is a hardy breed and can be stubborn leading to issues with training a ie may need to have its training refreshed on occasion during its lifetime having a typical prey drive it tends to be highly interested in toys especially chasing balls it does retain the instincts of an earth dog including inquisitive and investigative traits 6 as well as natural instincts to both bark and dig holes 5 it is ranked 47th in stanley coren s the intelligence of dogs 7 the american breed club puts the lifespan of the ie at 12 to 16 years 8 a club survey puts the average lifespan at 11 4 years 9 veterinary clinic data from the uk show a typical lifespan of 10 5 to 15 years 10 the french kennel club database gives 8 to 16 years with a median of 13 years 11 the typical litter size is between three and five puppies 2 however some litters may contain more than this one of which was a ie called isobel which gave birth to a litter of 11 puppies on 10 april 2012 other related breeds included george campbell 8th duke of argyll s roseneath and dr americ edwin flaxman s pittenweem s this breed of small scottish s was given its modern name for the first time in 1908 with recognition by major kennel clubs occurring around the same time
Whippet,the original s were thought to be english greyhounds that were too small for stag hunting in the forests of england these dogs were frequently returned to their breeders who were usually peasants and as such could not own hunting dogs under the forest law because of this dogs returned to them were maimed usually by cutting a tendon in a leg or removing the toes on one paw the breeders kept these dogs and continued to breed them producing a smaller version of a greyhound that was suited for rat catching and hunting hares and rabbits when the forest law was repealed the small greyhounds became immensely popular 7 9 s were then commonly known as snap dogs for their tendency to snap up nearby prey 7 in the picture by jean baptiste oudry 16861755 of two dogs presented to louis xv they are either s or small greyhounds but are probably related to an early form of 9 oudry also painted a second painting of misse with a different non sighthound dog there is a 1758 painting by pompeo batoni entitled portrait of charles compton 7th earl of northampton which features a similar like dog 9 s were bred to hunt by sight coursing game in open areas at high speeds one can find numerous representations of small greyhound like hounds in art dating back to ancient egyptian times 6 pharaohs bred a small sighthound dog related to the greyhound to keep in their palaces and this dog may be the ancestor of today s s 7 in medieval england a small greyhound breed became popular for use as a ratting dog 7 the first written english use of the word with regard to a type of dog was in 1610 8 however the first dog to be called a was actually a greyhound spaniel cross and has little to do with the modern 7 rags were a popular sunday event in the north and midlands at the time 9 there were also international events in australia at a track known as gurney s paddock there were races of more than 300 s every saturday and three nights a week at the white city track 18 eventually the sport evolved and dogs were divided into four groups those who hunted rabbits which was not governed by rules those who coursed hare for which a set of rules was established those trained to the rag and those trained to chase a mechanical lure in a fashion similar to greyhound races 9 few of the s of any of the four types were purebred as maintaining a purebred bloodline was not considered as important as breeding dogs that could win races 9 many racing dogs were part terrier part greyhound or part lurcher 9 the age of the modern dawned in 1891 when the kennel club granted the breed official recognition thus making the eligible for competition in dog shows and commencing the recording of their pedigrees 11 in the united states the was recognised in 1888 by the american kennel club 11 s arrived in the united states with mill operators from england and the first populations were established in massachusetts 12 the is the 55th most popular breed according to the american kennel club 13 the also english or snap dog is a dog breed of medium size they are a sighthound breed that originated in england where they descended from greyhounds s today still strongly resemble a smaller greyhound shown in the hound group s have relatively few health problems other than arrhythmia s also participate in dog sports such as lure coursing agility and flyball the name is derived from an early 17th century word now obsolete meaning to move briskly 3 s were originally greyhounds that were deemed unsuitable for hunting because of their size they were returned to their peasant breeders after being maimed so that they could not be used to hunt and break the forest law these maimed dogs were bred together and used to catch rats and hunt rabbits when the forest law was repealed these miniature greyhounds became popular in the sport of dog racing this has led to s being described as the poor man s racehorse 4 they are still frequently used as racing dogs today as they have the highest running speed of breeds their weight 40 miles per hour 64 km h and even challenge greyhounds for top speed s are however the fastest accelerating dog in the world 5 dog racing was originally an extension of hare coursing 18 s began to be bred to race in the mid nineteenth century 4 9 the first form of the sport was a rudimentary form of coursing known as ragging and dogs who participated were said to be trained to the rag 9 dogs were kept on a leash by a person known as a slip who was frequently also the race judge 9 the slip would release the dogs from their collars at the same time and they would race towards their owners who were standing at the opposite end of the track waving towels 9 18 in the nineteenth century racing was a major sport in england 4 9 the was held in high regard in the northern parts of england and wales but was generally disregarded in the rest of the country 9 at the time there were two varieties of the first type had a smooth coat was more popular in lancashire yorkshire and the midlands and became the modern 9 the other had a rough coat from crossbreeding with bedlington terriers was more popular in durham and northumberland and was frequently referred to as a rabbit dog 9 early specimens were taken from the race track by the dog fanciers of the time and exported around the world john taylor said that in all the shapes and forms of dogges of all which there are but two sorts that are useful to man s profits which two are the mastiffe and the little curre or house dogge all the rest are for pleasure and recreation 10 in 1964 ch courtenay fleetfoot of pennyworth won best in show at the westminster kennel club dog show 14 in 1992 pencloe dutch gold won best in show at crufts 15 and a known as cobyco call the tune won in 2004 16 in 2011 gch starline s chanel a female was chosen as the hound show dog of the year by the westminster kennel club 17
Yorkshire_Terrier,the ideal character or personality is described with a carriage very upright and conveying an important air 19 though small the is active very overprotective curious and fond of attention mentally sound and emotionally secure ones should normally not show the soft submissive temperament seen in lap dogs although many exhibit this behaviour due to improper training because of this it is advised that a yorkie would not be suitable for a home with typical young children instead they make ideal companions for older families with many more reputable breeders routinely only homing to families with children older than about 8 years for the comfort of the dog but more so for the benefit of the child in the early days of the breed almost anything in the shape of a having a long coat with blue on the body and fawn or silver coloured head and legs with tail docked and ears trimmed was received and admired as a 6 but in the late 1860s a popular paisley type show dog named huddersfield ben owned by a woman living in mary ann foster was seen at dog shows throughout great britain and defined the breed type for the 11 from the back of the neck to the base of the tail the coat should be a dark gray to a black colour and the hair on the tail should be a darker black on the head high chest and legs the hair should be a bright rich tan darker at the roots than in the middle that shades into a lighter tan at the tips but not for all dogs also in adult dogs there should be no black hairs intermingled with any of the tan coloured fur it may take three or more years for the coat to reach its final colour the final colour is usually a black grayish colour 29 p h combs writing in 1891 complained about show wins awarded to puppies when the dog s coat does not fully come in until three or four years old and the honor of winning such a prize for a puppy can therefore be of but little practical benefit to the owner since the adult dog s colour cannot be exactly predicted 30 31 certain genetic disorders have been found in s including distichiasis hydrocephalus hypoplasia of dens leggcalvéperthes syndrome luxating patella portosystemic shunt retinal dysplasia tracheal collapse and bladder stones 40 the following are among the most common congenital defects that affect yorkies the is a tan dog with a blue saddle particolours exist although they are not correct for the breed standard the particolour coat is white with black blue and tan the white is caused by the recessive piebald gene it is very rare to get a particolour and if one is found it tends to be very expensive 26 some s are solid golden they only produce pheomelanin others are liver or chocolate a brown colour they only produce brown eumelanin but are unable to produce black eumelanin 27 the breed is defined by its colour and such non standard colours may indicate health problems or cross breeding with other breeds of other colours 21 the akc registration form for s allows for four choices blue and tan blue and gold black and tan black and gold colour alone will not affect whether or not a dog is a good companion and pet even though off coloured s are advertised at premium prices being of an unusual or atypical colour is neither new desirable nor exotic 26 the long coat on the means that the breed requires regular brushing 3 the is a small dog breed of type developed during the 19th century in england to catch rats in clothing mills 3 the defining feature of the breed is its maximum size of 7 pounds 3 2 kg 4 although some may exceed this and grow up to 15 pounds 6 8 kg it is placed in the toy section of the group by the fédération cynologique internationale and in the toy group or companion group by other kennel clubs including the american kennel club a popular companion dog the has also been part of the development of other breeds such as the australian silky it has a grey black and tan coat and the breed s nickname is yorkie the also called a yorkie originated in and adjoining lancashire a county in northern england 3 5 in the mid 19th century workers from scotland came to in search of work and brought with them several different varieties of small s breeding of the was principally accomplished by the peoplemostly operatives in cotton and woolen millsin the counties of and lancashire 6 details are scarce mrs a foster is quoted as saying in 1886 if we consider that the mill operatives who originated the breed were nearly all ignorant men unaccustomed to imparting information for public use we may see some reason why reliable facts have not been easily attained 7 huddersfield ben was a famous dog his portrait was painted by george earl 12 and in 1891 an authority on the breed wrote huddersfield ben was the best stud dog of his breed during his lifetime and one of the most remarkable dogs of any pet breed that ever lived and most of the show specimens of the present day have one or more crosses of his blood in their pedigree 13 a show winner huddersfield ben quickly became the type of dog everyone wanted and through his puppies has defined the breed as we know it today he is still referred to as father of the breed 11 until recently mismatched s could be crossed with biewer s a new breed originated in germany from particoloured s 28 although the american kennel club will not deny registration of a on colour alone meaning that particolours are now registerable with the akc the club of america has a directive that any solid colour or combination of colours other than black and tan for adult dogs is a disqualification and dogs of solid colour unusual combination of colours and particolours should be disqualified 29 the breed sprang from three different dogs a male named old crab a female named kitty and another female whose name is not known 8 the paisley a smaller version of the skye that was bred for a beautiful long silky coat also figured into the early dogs some authorities believed that the maltese was used as well 9 they were all originally bred from scotch s note meaning dogs from scotland not today s scottish and shown as such the name was given to them on account of their being improved so much in 7 s were shown in a dog show category class at the time called rough and broken coated broken haired scotch and s hugh dalziel writing in 1878 says that the classification of these dogs at shows and in the kennel club stud book is confusing and absurd in lumping together these different types 10 s do tend to bark a lot this makes them excellent watchdogs as they will sound the alarm when anyone gets close however this barking problem can be resolved with proper training and exercise the was introduced in north america in 1872 5 and the first was registered with the american kennel club akc in 1885 3 14 during the victorian era the was a popular pet and show dog in england and as americans embraced victorian customs so too did they embrace the 15 the breed s popularity dipped in the 1940s when the percentage of small breed dogs registered fell to an all time low of 18 of total registrations 16 smoky a and famous war dog from world war ii is credited with beginning a renewal of interest in the breed 17 the american kennel club ranked the as the 6th most popular pure breed in the united states of america in 2012 and 2013 3 for adult s importance is placed on coat colour quality and texture 18 the hair must be glossy fine straight and silky traditionally the coat is grown out very long and is parted down the middle of the back but must never impede movement 19 like other small breeds yorkies are also prone to severe dental disease because they have a small jaw their teeth can become crowded and may not fall out naturally this can cause food and plaque to build up and bacteria can eventually develop on the surface of the teeth leading to periodontal disease in addition the bacteria can spread to other parts of the body and cause heart and kidney problems the best prevention is regular brushing of the teeth with a toothpaste formulated specifically for dogs human toothpaste is not recommended because it foams more easily and may be swallowed professional teeth cleaning by a veterinarian may also be required to prevent the development of dental problems 39 yorkies and other small dog breeds may have problems if the deciduous or baby teeth do not fall out as the permanent or adult teeth grow this is caused by the new teeth not growing right underneath the deciduous teeth usually a puppys body will absorb the roots of puppy teeth if the puppy tooth does not yield to the incoming tooth it should be removed because it can cause a malocclusion or bad bite 37 retained teeth can cause tooth decay because food can be easily caught in between the deciduous and permanent teeth sometimes the new teeth are forced to grow into an abnormal position and further cause a bad bite the retained teeth may stay or fall weeks after the new teeth have developed when necessary the retained deciduous or baby teeth need to be removed surgically 38 s are ranked 27th in stanley coren s the intelligence of dogs 33 owners may trim the fur short for easier care for shows the coat is left long and may be trimmed to floor length to give ease of movement and a neater appearance hair on the feet and the tips of ears can also be trimmed 18 19 the traditional long coat is extremely high maintenance the coat might get knotted if not brushed daily to prevent breakage the coat may be wrapped in rice paper tissue paper or plastic after a light oiling with a coat oil the oil has to be washed out once a month and the wraps must be fixed periodically during the week to prevent them from sliding down and breaking the hair elaborate coat care dates from the earliest days of the breed in 1878 john walsh described similar preparations the coat is well greased with coconut oil the dog is bathed weekly and the dog s feet are carefully kept in stockings 32 health issues often seen in the include bronchitis lymphangiectasia portosystemic shunt cataracts and keratitis sicca 34 additionally yorkies often have a delicate digestive system with vomiting or diarrhea resulting from consumption of foods outside of a regular diet 1 the relatively small size of the means that it usually has a poor tolerance for anesthesia additionally a toy dog such as the yorkie is more likely to be injured by falls other dogs and owner clumsiness 1 injection reactions inflammation or hair loss at the site of an injection can occur in addition allergies can cause skin to be dry itchy and or red 35 the typical fine straight and silky coat has also been listed by many popular dog information websites as being hypoallergenic in comparison with many other breeds yorkies do not shed to the same degree only losing small amounts when bathed or brushed 22 and it is the dog s dander and saliva that trigger most allergic reactions 23 allergists do recognize that at times a particular allergy patient will be able to tolerate a particular dog but they agree that the luck of the few with their pets cannot be stretched to fit all allergic people and entire breeds of dogs 24 the coat is said to fall out only when brushed or broken or just said to not shed 25 although neither of those statements agree with what biologists veterinarians and allergists know about dog fur allergists think there really are differences in protein production between dogs that may help one patient and not another 24 adult s that have other coat colours than the above or that have woolly or extra fine coats are still s the only difference is that atypical s should not intentionally be bred 20 in addition care may be more difficult for woolly or cottony textured coats or coats that are overly fine 18 one of the reasons given for not breeding off coloured yorkies is that the colour could be a potential indicator of a genetic defect that may affect the dog s health a careful health screening can clarify if any health risks exist 21 coats may vary in colour for example a grown yorkie may have a silver blue with light brown while another might have a black and creamy colour the life span of a yorkie is 1320 years 1 2 undersized yorkies 3 pounds or less generally have a shorter life span as they are especially prone to health problems such as chronic diarrhea and vomiting are even more sensitive to anesthesia and are more easily injured 1 as with all other dogs yorkies have two sets of teeth in their life the first set of
