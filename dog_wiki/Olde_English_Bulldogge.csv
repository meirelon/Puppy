0,Olde_English_Bulldogge,"Leavitt formed the Olde English Bulldogge Association (OEBA) to maintain the breed's stud book and issue registration papers to future offspring.[3] During the 1980s Ben and Karen Campetti from Sandisfield, Massachusetts worked closely with Leavitt in breeding the Olde English Bulldogge.[2] In 1993 Leavitt stopped breeding and turned the OEBA registry as well as his personal breeding stock over to Working Dog Inc. which was owned and operated by Michael Walz of Pennsylvania.[2]","The Olde English Bulldogge was an attempt to recreate the ""Regency Period Bull Baiter"" and was developed in the early 1970s by David Leavitt, of Coatesville, PA.[1] Leavitt began his project in 1971 utilizing the cattle line breeding scheme of Dr. Fechimer from Ohio State University.[1] The goal was to create a dog with the look, health, and athleticism of the original bull-baiting dogs, but with a much less aggressive temperament.[1] The foundation crosses consisted of ½ English Bulldog, and 1/6th American Bulldog, 1/6th American Pit Bull Terrier and 1/6th Bull Mastiff.[1] After many planned crosses, the Olde English Bulldogge emerged and began to breed true.[2]","The Olde English Bulldogge may be a healthier breed of dog than many modern Bulldog breeds, though they can be affected by many of the same disorders that occur in any breed. Proponents of the breed maintain that it does not suffer from the same disorders as purebred English bulldogs.[9] Many breeders are now x-raying hips to reduce the incidence of hip dysplasia as well as having dogs evaluated by organizations such as the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) and the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). The Olde English Bulldogge is also quickly becoming well respected in many working venues such as weight pull, therapy training, and obedience. They have become excellent breathers, but still are very sensitive to heat. Artificial insemination is not a standard protocol when breeding Olde English Bulldogges; natural ties are the standard. Breeders from the Olde English Bulldogge Kennel Club are working vigorously on educating new breeders on genetic disorders and the benefits modern genetic testing for these disorders can have on preventing genetic disorders in domestic animals.[citation needed] Many breeders are also becoming more aware of how important selective breeding can be to the breed as a whole.","In 2001 the Olde English Bulldogge Kennel Club (OEBKC) was formed,[2] and in 2005 David Leavitt was involved with merging the Olde English Bulldogge Association's registry with that of the OEBKC's.[4] The Olde English Bulldogge was enrolled with the Canine Developmental Health and Performance Registry (CDHPR) in August 2008 in order to evaluate the breed for recognition within the UKC as a purebred breed of dog[5] and in 2013 the UKC announced that the Olde English Bulldogge would become a fully recognized breed as of January 1, 2014.[6] The OEBKC is currently the recognized Parent Club for the breed with the United Kennel Club (UKC).[7]","The Olde English Bulldogge is a recently created American dog breed. In the 1970s David Leavitt created a true-breeding lineage as a re-creation of the healthier working bulldog from early nineteenth century England. Using a breeding scheme developed for cattle, Leavitt crossed English bulldogs with American Bulldogs, American Pit Bull Terriers and Bull Mastiffs. The result was an athletic breed that looks similar to the bulldogs of 1820 but also has a friendly temperament.","The skull is large and well-proportioned to the dog’s muscular body and prominent shoulders.
