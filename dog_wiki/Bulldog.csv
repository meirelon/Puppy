0,Bulldog,"The Bulldog has a longstanding association with British culture, with the BBC stating: ""to many the Bulldog is a national icon, symbolising pluck and determination.""[6] During World War II the Bulldog was often likened to Prime Minister Winston Churchill and his defiance of Nazi Germany.[7]","According to the American Kennel Club (AKC), a Bulldog's disposition should be ""equable and kind, resolute, and courageous (not vicious or aggressive), and demeanor should be pacific and dignified. These attributes should be countenanced by the expression and behavior"".[9]","The Bulldog is a medium-sized breed of dog commonly referred to as the English Bulldog or British Bulldog. Other Bulldog breeds include the American Bulldog, Old English Bulldog (now extinct), Leavitt Bulldog, Olde English Bulldogge, and the French Bulldog. The Bulldog is a muscular, hefty dog with a wrinkled face and a distinctive pushed-in nose.[4] The American Kennel Club (AKC), The Kennel Club (UK), and the United Kennel Club (UKC) oversee breeding records. Bulldogs were the fourth most popular purebreed in the US in 2015 according to the American Kennel Club.[5]","The term ""Bulldog"" was first mentioned in literature around 1500, the oldest spelling of the word being Bondogge and Bolddogge. The first reference to the word with the modern spelling is dated 1631 or 1632 in a letter by a man named Preswick Eaton where he writes: ""procuer mee two good Bulldogs, and let them be sent by ye first shipp"".[11] In 1666, English scientist Christopher Merret applied: ""Canis pugnax, a Butchers Bull or Bear Dog"", as an entry in his Pinax Rerum Naturalium Britannicarum.[12]","Bulldogs are one of the few breeds whose tail is naturally short and either straight or screwed and thus is not cut or docked as with some other breeds. A straight tail is a more desirable tail according to the breed standard set forth by the BCA if it is facing downward, not upwards.","In the United Kingdom, the breed standards are 55 lb (25 kg) for a male and 50 lb (23 kg) for a female.[8] In the United States, a typical mature male weighs 50 lb (23 kg), while mature females weigh about 40 lb (18 kg).[4] The BCA recommends the average weight of a bulldog to be 40–50 lb (18–23 kg).","Generally, Bulldogs are known for getting along well with children, other dogs, and pets.[10]","Breeders have worked to reduce/remove aggression from these dogs.[4] Most have a friendly, patient nature. Bulldogs are recognized as excellent family pets because of their tendency to form strong bonds with children.[4]","The Bulldog is a breed with characteristically wide head and shoulders along with a pronounced mandibular prognathism. There are generally thick folds of skin on a Bulldog's brow; round, black, wide-set eyes; a short muzzle with characteristic folds called a rope or nose roll above the nose; hanging skin under the neck; drooping lips and pointed teeth, and an underbite with an upturned jaw. The coat is short, flat, and sleek, with colours of red, fawn, white, brindle, and piebald.[4]"
