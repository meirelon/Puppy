0,West_Highland_White_Terrier,"The West Highland White Terrier, commonly known as the Westie or Westy, is a breed of dog from Scotland with a distinctive white fluffy coat. The modern breed is descended from a number of breeding programs of white terriers in Scotland before the 20th century. Edward Donald Malcolm, 16th Laird of Poltalloch, is credited with the creation of the modern breed from his Poltalloch Terrier, but did not want to be known as such.","The breed is prone to skin disorders.[2] About a quarter of Westies surveyed are affected by atopic dermatitis, a heritable chronic allergic skin condition. A higher proportion of males are affected compared to females.[14] An uncommon but severe breed-specific skin condition, hyperplastic dermatosis, may affect West Highland White Terriers, both juveniles and adults dogs. Affected dogs can suffer from red hyperpigmentation, lichenification, and hair loss. In the initial stages, this condition can be misdiagnosed as allergies or less serious forms of dermatitis.[15]","The breed is predisposed to conditions found in many breeds, such as abdominal hernias.[12] Westie puppies may be affected by craniomandibular osteopathy, a disease also known as ""lion jaw"", and is sometimes also referred to as ""westie jaw"". The disease is an autosomal recessive condition, so a puppy can only be affected by it if both its parents are carriers of the faulty gene. The condition appears across many breeds, including several different types of terriers, as well as other unrelated breeds such as the Great Dane. It typically appears in dogs under a year old, and can cause problems for the dog to chew or swallow food. Radiographic testing can be conducted to diagnose the condition, in which the bones around the jaw thicken; additionally, the blood may show increased calcium levels and enzyme levels. The condition often stops progressing by the time the dog is a year old, and in some cases can recede. It is normally treated with anti-inflammatory medications, and the feeding of soft foods. In some cases, tube feeding may be necessary. However, if the animal still cannot eat and is in uncontrolled pain, then euthanasia may be the only medical option remaining.[13]","The breed remains very popular in the UK, twice winner at Cruft's, and is in the top third of all breeds in the US since the 1960s. It has been featured in television and film, including in Hamish Macbeth and in advertising by companies such as Cesar dog food and Scottish whisky Black & White. It is a medium-sized terrier, although with longer legs than other Scottish breeds of terrier. It has a white double coat of fur which fills out the dog's face, giving it a rounded appearance. The breed can be good with children, but does not always tolerate rough handling. The Westie is an active and intelligent breed, and is social with a high prey drive, as they were once used to hunt rodents.","Several breed-specific and nonspecific health issues appear in the breed, including a condition in young dogs nicknamed ""westie jaw"" which causes an overgrowth of bone in the jaw of the dog. It can also be prone to skin disorders, with a breed-specific condition called hyperplastic dermatosis occurring. They are very energetic and need plenty of exercise. Cousin to the Cairn Terrier, the Westie was bred to hunt small rodents at places such as farms.","They have a soft, dense, thick undercoat and a rough outer coat,[1] which can grow to about 2 inches (5.1 cm) long.[2] The fur fills out the face to give a rounded appearance.[1] As puppies develop into adults, their coarse outer coat is normally removed by either ""hand-stripping"", especially for dog-showing, or otherwise clipping.[1]","The temperament of the West Highland White Terrier can vary greatly, with some being friendly towards children, whilst others prefer solitude.[4] It will not tolerate rough handling such as a child pulling on its ears, and can be both food- and toy-possessive.[5] It is normally independent, assured, and self-confident, and can make a good watchdog. It is a loyal breed that bonds with its owner, but is often always on the move, requiring good exercise (15–30 min). The Westie is highly social and is the most friendly and jolly of all the Scottish breeds of terriers.[6]","Commonly, Westies have bright, deep-set, almond-shaped eyes that are dark in colour. Their ears are pointed and erect.[1] Members of the breed typically weigh between 15 and 20 pounds (6.8 and 9.1 kg), and the average height is between 10–11 inches (25–28 cm) at the withers.[1] The body should be shorter than the height of the dog at the shoulder.[1]","They also have a deep chest, muscular limbs, a black nose, and a short, closely fitted jaw with ""scissors"" bite (lower canines locked in front of upper canines, upper incisors locked over lower incisors).[2] The Westie's paws are slightly turned out to give it better grip than flat-footed breeds when it climbs on rocky surfaces.[3] In young puppies, the nose and footpads have pink markings, which slowly turn black as they age.[2]","It is a hardy breed, and can be stubborn, leading to issues with training. A Westie may need to have its training refreshed on occasion during its lifetime. Having a typical terrier prey drive, it tends to be highly interested in toys, especially chasing balls. It does retain the instincts of an earth-dog, including inquisitive and investigative traits,[6] as well as natural instincts to both bark and dig holes.[5] It is ranked 47th in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs.[7]","The American breed club puts the lifespan of the Westie at 12 to 16 years.[8] A club survey puts the average lifespan at 11.4 years.[9] Veterinary clinic data from the UK show a typical lifespan of 10.5 to 15 years.[10] The French Kennel Club database gives 8 to 16 years, with a median of 13 years.[11] The typical litter size is between three and five puppies.[2] However, some litters may contain more than this, one of which was a Westie called Isobel, which gave birth to a litter of 11 puppies on 10 April 2012.","Other related breeds included George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll's Roseneath Terrier and Dr. Americ Edwin Flaxman's Pittenweem Terriers. This breed of small white Scottish terriers was given its modern name for the first time in 1908, with recognition by major kennel clubs occurring around the same time."
