0,Pug,"Pugs' legs are very strong, straight, of moderate length, and are set well under. Their shoulders are moderately laid back. Their ankles are strong, their feet are small, their toes are well split-up, and their nails are black.[5] The lower teeth normally protrude further than their upper, resulting in an under-bite.[1]","The breed is often described by the Latin phrase multum in parvo, or ""much in little"" or ""a lot of dog in a small space"", alluding to the Pug's remarkable and charming personality, despite its small size.[1] Pugs are strong willed but rarely aggressive, and are suitable for families with children. The majority of the breed is very fond of children and sturdy enough to properly play with them. Depending on their owner's mood, they can be quiet and docile but also vivacious and teasing.[8] Pugs tend to be intuitive and sensitive to the moods of their owners and are usually eager to please them.[3] Pugs tend to have a somewhat lazy nature and spend a lot of time napping. They are often called ""shadows"" because they follow their owners around and like to stay close to the action,[9] craving attention and affection from their owners.[10][11]","Pugs have two distinct shapes for their ears, ""rose"" and ""button"". ""Rose"" ears are smaller than the standard style of ""button"" ears, and are folded with the front edge against the side of the head. Breeding preference goes to ""button"" style ears.[7]",Un-exaggerated wrinkles; nose features common narrow nostrils,"The Pug is a breed of dog with a wrinkly, short-muzzled face, and curled tail. The breed has a fine, glossy coat that comes in a variety of colours, most often fawn or black, and a compact square body with well-developed muscles.","Pugs were popular at European courts, and reportedly become the official dog of the House of Orange in 1572 after a Pug named Pompey saved the life of the Prince of Orange by alerting him to the approach of assassins.[1]","The breed has strong, straight legs set well under the body and a tail that curls over the hip","Fawn is the most common color for a pug, but the American Kennel Club also recognizes the color black. The Canadian Kennel Club recognizes the colors black, silver, apricot, and fawn.","While the pugs that are depicted in eighteenth century prints tend to be long and lean,[2] modern breed preferences are for a square cobby body, a compact form, a deep chest, and well-developed muscle.[5] Their smooth and glossy coats can be fawn, apricot fawn, silver fawn, or black.[5][6] The markings are clearly defined, and there is a trace of a black line extending from the occiput to the tail.[5] The tail normally curls tightly over the hip.[2]","Pugs were brought from China to Europe in the sixteenth century and were popularized in Western Europe by the House of Orange of the Netherlands, and the House of Stuart.[2] In the United Kingdom, in the nineteenth century, Queen Victoria developed a passion for pugs which she passed on to other members of the Royal family.",The early history of the Pug is not attested to in detail; it is accepted that modern Pugs are descended from dogs imported to Europe from China in the 16th century. Similar dogs were popular in the Imperial court during the Song Dynasty.[12],"In ancient times, Pugs were bred to be companions for ruling families in China. The pet Pugs were highly valued by Chinese Emperors, and the royal dogs were kept in luxury and guarded by soldiers.[3] Pugs later spread to other parts of Asia. In Tibet, Buddhist monks kept Pugs as pets in their monasteries.[3] The breed has retained its affectionate devotion to its owners since ancient times.[3]",Eyes should be large with a rounded shape and dark in colour,"Pugs are known for being sociable and gentle companion dogs.[3] The breed remains popular into the twenty-first century, with some famous celebrity owners. A pug was judged Best in Show at the World Dog Show in 2004.[4]"
