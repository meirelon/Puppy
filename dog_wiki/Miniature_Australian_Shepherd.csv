0,Miniature_Australian_Shepherd,"The preferred height of this variety ranges from 14 to 18 inches (35 to 46 cm) at the withers and the weight is typically between 17 and 30 pounds (9 to 14 kg). Coat color combinations include 16 basic possibilities. ""These combinations are the most common accounting for colors (red or black), coat pattern (solid or merle) and the degree of tan points and white markings."" [1] Combinations include: self black, black and tan, black bicolor, black tricolor, self blue merle, blue merle and tan, blue merle and white, blue merle and white and tan, self red, red and tan, red bicolor, red tricolor, self red merle, red merle and tan, red merle and white, and red merle and white and tan. Eyes may be any combination of brown, amber, hazel, blue, or marbled. Some of these dog have eyes that are two different colors or may be marbled or swirled. Some may have a natural bobtail or the tail may be docked.","The 'Miniature Australian Shepherd' was developed by breeding smaller Australian Shepherds (a US-developed breed, despite their name). The variety – not yet formally recognized as sub-breed of Australian Shepherd by any major breed registries – is a compact type, with strong working dog behaviors, and is trained for dog agility trials and other dog sports including herding, obedience, disc dog, flyball, and other activities. The Mini Aussie is recognized by MASCA not the AKC which recognizes the North American Shepherd. The Mini Aussies's DNA is exactly the same as the larger Australian Shepherd, unlike the North American Shepherd.","Persistent pupillary membrane (PPM): PPM is rare, but possible. During normal development, a puppy's eyes are enveloped by a membrane which stretches and breaks away by 8 weeks of age. In an affected dog, the membranes fail to break free, whether on the front of the eye, or behind it. It causes varying degrees of vision impairment depending on placement and concentration of the strands. Diagnosis can be mild to severe. If strands have not broken free by 8 weeks, the dog is inclined to carry them for the rest of its life.","In 1978 Doris Cordova, a horse woman in Norco, California, began a breeding program specifically to produce very small variety founded with Australian Shepherds. Her foundation stud was Cordova's Spike. Spike was placed with Bill and Sally Kennedy, also of Norco, California, to continue to develop a line of smaller dogs under the B/S kennel name. Another horseman, Chas Lasater of Valhalla Kennels, soon joined the ranks of mini breeders. In the 1980s fanciers formed member clubs (North American Miniature Australian Shepherd Club of the USA and the Miniature Australian Shepherd Association) and registries to promote the smaller dogs in particular. Doris Cordova wrote a letter of explanation regarding the intent of developing the variety which was published in the National Stock Dog Magazine, Vol. 28, No.1 Spring issue of 1982.[2]","Iris Colobomas (IC): A cleft in the iris of the eye. If large, it will impair vision. A dog with a small IC may be sensitive to bright light. While the exact mode of inheritance is unknown, it is probably polygenetic. They may also be the result of abnormal development in puppies from merle to merle breedings.",Eye defects of varying severity are the most common disorder in Australian Shepherds of all size varieties. The following disorders have been recognized in the Australian Shepherd of all sizes:,"Juvenile cataracts: A congenital opacity of the lens of the eye due to abnormal early degeneration of the lens tissue. This can result in gradual and painless deterioration of sight, resulting in partial or complete blindness by 2 to 5 years of age.","Mini Aussies are very easily trained, but their intelligence and drive require that they be engaged in obedience training and plenty of interesting activities. They are easily trainable because they crave approval. Once given proper socialization they will thrive in a variety of environments, provided they have an adequate outlet for both physical and mental energy. If they are not allowed adequate stimuli they may become destructive. Because of their herding background, they also may have the tendency to try to herd people, especially small children, nipping at their heels. This instinct can be modified through early intervention and training. They are social dogs and form close attachments to their owner. As a result, some may suffer separation anxiety. Miniature Australian Shepherds function well as a family dog, but their excessive energy may need to be checked around small children. They are generally great house dogs but do require a large amount of exercise. They are particularly apprehensive with strangers..."
