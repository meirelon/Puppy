0,Cairn_Terrier,"Although the breed had existed long before, the name 'Cairn Terrier' was a compromise suggestion after the breed was originally brought to official shows in the United Kingdom in 1909 under the name Short-haired Skye terriers. This name was not acceptable to The Kennel Club due to opposition from Skye Terrier breeders, and the name 'Cairn Terrier' was suggested as an alternative. They are usually left-pawed,[3] which has been shown in dogs to correlate to superior performance in tasks related to scent. Cairn terriers are ratters.","It is wise to have a pet examined to rule out heritable skin diseases if a Cairn is obtained from unknown sources (i.e. pet stores, rescues, or puppy mills).[citation needed]","Cairn terriers are particularly easily trained; ethical breeders strongly suggest obedience school or some other type of training to direct Cairn terrier's focus on the owner as the one in command if they are going to be used for hunting. If allowed to take control of the household, behavior problems may develop that can only be resolved by hiring a professional dog trainer. Many breeders only sell puppies to dedicated dog owners who agree to basic obedience school.",These dogs are generally healthy and live on average about 12 to 17 years.[6][7],"Cairns originated in the Highlands of Scotland and the Isle of Skye,[4] initially grouped in the ""Skye Terrier"" class alongside the Scottish and West Highland White terriers. In the early 1900s, the three breeds began to be bred separately.","The Kennel Club UK gave the Cairn terrier a separate register in 1912, during which year 134 were registered and it was in this year that the breed was also given Championship status.[5]","The Cairn Terrier is one of the oldest of the terrier breeds, originating in the Scottish Highlands and recognized as one of Scotland's earliest working dogs. The breed was given the name Cairn, because the breed's function was to hunt and chase quarry between the cairns in the Scottish highlands.[2]",Some of the more common hereditary health problems found in the Cairn are:[8],"Breeders, owners, and veterinarians have identified several health problems that are significant for Cairns. Some of these diseases are hereditary, while others occur as a result of nonspecific factors (i.e. infections, toxins, injuries, or advanced age). Currently, the Cairn Terrier Club of America, along with the Institute for Genetic Disease Control in Animals, maintains an open registry for Cairn terriers in hopes of reducing the occurrence of hereditary diseases within the breed. Breeders voluntarily submit their dogs' test results for research purposes, as well as for use by individuals who seek to make sound breeding decisions.","Cairn terrier ancestors are from Scotland, where the wire coat repels water and keeps the dog dry even in rainy or damp climates. Keeping the Cairn terrier coat in its original state will prevent possible skin irritations. As dead hair is removed by stripping the coat, new growth comes in and the skin and coat remain healthy. Clipper-cutting a Cairn might destroy the protective wire coat unique to this breed.",Cairn terriers exist happily in an apartment if sufficiently exercised.[citation needed] They are very active indoors and suffice even without a yard.[citation needed] Daily walks help keep Cairn terriers happy and healthy. Fenced-in yards are strongly recommended for safety and well being as well as being kept on leash when not in the yard.,"Cairn terriers shed very little, but should always be hand stripped. Using scissors or shears can ruin the dog's rugged outer coat after one grooming. Hand stripping involves pulling the old dead hair out by the roots. If done incorrectly, this can cause discomfort to the dog, causing it to shy away from future hand stripping. Removing the dead hair in this manner allows new growth to come in. This new growth helps protect the dog from water and dirt."
