0,Great_Dane,"Bigger dogs are depicted on numerous runestones in Scandinavia, on coinage in Denmark from the fifth century AD, and in the collection of Old Norse poems, known in English as Poetic Edda. The University of Copenhagen Zoological Museum holds at least seven skeletons of very large hunting dogs, dating from the fifth century BC to 1000 AD.","In the 19th century, the dog was known as a ""German boarhound"" in English-speaking countries.[30] Some German breeders tried to introduce the names ""German Dogge"" and ""German Mastiff"" on the English market, because they believed the breed should be marketed as a dog of luxury and not as a working dog.[26] However, due to the increasing tensions between Germany and other countries, the dog later became referred to as a ""Great Dane"", after the grand danois[31] in Buffon's Histoire naturelle, générale et particulière in 1755.","These large boarhounds continue to appear throughout ancient Greece in subsequent centuries up to the Hellenistic era.[12][13][14][15] The Molossian hound, Suliot dog, and specific imports from Greece were used in the 18th century to increase the stature of the boarhounds in Austria and Germany and the wolfhounds in Ireland.[16][17][18][19][20][21][22]","The dogs were used for hunting bear, boar, and deer at princely courts, with the favorites staying at night in the bedchambers of their lords. These Kammerhunde (chamber dogs) were outfitted with gilded collars, and helped protect the sleeping princes from assassins.[28][29]","The Great Dane combines, in its regal appearance, dignity, strength, and elegance with great size and a powerful, well-formed, smoothly muscled body. It is one of the giant working breeds, but is unique in that its general conformation must be so well balanced that it never appears clumsy, and shall move with a long reach and powerful drive.[2] The Great Dane is a short-haired breed with a strong, galloping figure.[33]","While hunting boar or bears, the Englische Dogge was a catch dog used after the other hunting dogs to seize the bear or boar and hold it in place until the huntsman was able to kill it. When the hunting customs changed, particularly because of the use of firearms, many of the involved dog types disappeared. The Englische Dogge became rare, and was kept only as a dog of hobby or luxury.","The Great Dane is a large German breed of domestic dog known for its giant size. The German name of the breed is Deutsche Dogge, or German Mastiff. The French name is Dogue Allemand.[2][3][4][5][6][7][8]","The Great Dane is one of the tallest dog breeds. The record holder for tallest dog was a Great Dane called Zeus (died September 2014; aged 5), that measured 111.8 cm (44.0 in) from paw to shoulder.[9][10] Scooby-Doo is a famous fictional dog of this breed.","Large boarhounds resembling the Great Dane appear in ancient Greece, in frescoes from Tiryns dating back to the 14th–13th centuries BC.[11]",As described by the American Kennel Club:,The Great Dane is a large German domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris) known for its giant size.[2][3][4][5][6][7][8][32],"In the middle of the 16th century, the nobility in many countries of Europe imported strong, long-legged dogs from England, which were descended from crossbreeds between English Mastiffs and Irish Wolfhounds. They were dog hybrids in different sizes and phenotypes with no formal breed.[23] These dogs were called Englische Docke or Englische Tocke – later written and spelled: Dogge – or Englischer Hund in Germany. The name simply meant ""English dog"". After time, the English word ""dog"" came to be the term for a molossoid dog in Germany[24] and in France.[25] Since the beginning of the 17th century, these dogs were bred in the courts of German nobility, independently of England.[26][27]"
