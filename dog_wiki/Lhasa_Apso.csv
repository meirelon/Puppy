0,Lhasa_Apso,"The Lhasa Apso (/?l??s? ?æpso?/ LAH-s? AP-soh) is a non-sporting dog breed originating in Tibet.[1] It was bred as an interior sentinel in the Buddhist monasteries, to alert the monks to any intruders who entered. Lhasa is the capital city of Tibet, and apso is a word in the Tibetan language meaning ""bearded"", so, Lhasa Apso simply means ""long-haired Lhasa dog"". There are, however, some who claim that the word ""apso"" is a form of the Tibetan word ""rapso"", meaning ""goat-like"",[2] which would make the equivalent translation ""wooly Lhasa dog"".","Referred to in Tibet as Apso Seng Kyi, which can be translated as ""Bearded Lion Dog"", the Lhasa's primary function was that of a household sentinel, guarding the homes of Tibetan nobility and Buddhist monasteries, particularly in or near the sacred city of Lhasa. The large Tibetan Mastiffs guarded the monasteries' entrances, but the keen hearing and sharp bark of the Lhasa Apso served to warn residents by acting like a burglar alarm if an intruder happened to get past the exterior guards.","A Lhasa Apso responds to exercise and discipline with a calm assertive energy. These dogs require early socialization with dogs and other people as puppies and throughout their lives. Because Lhasa Apsos are an independent and intelligent breed, house training puppies requires consistency. They require patience and may be slow to house train, but in return, they can be quite comical, entertaining and caring companions.[citation needed] They aim to please their owners and enjoy training. While their personality belies their size, they need a home that is mindful that there is a small dog in the house to prevent injury. They enjoy vantage points in the house where they can view all that is going on.","Having been bred as an indoor monastery sentinel dog by Tibetan Buddhist monks, Lhasa Apsos are alert with a keen sense of hearing. The ideal Lhasa temperament is to be wary of strangers while being loyal to those closest to them. They can be very aggressive to strangers if they're left untrained. They rank 68th (out of 79) in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs, being of fair working-obedience intelligence.[4][5]","The Lhasa Apso is a long-lived breed, with many living in good health into their early 20s.[7] The average age for these dogs is 12–14. There are few health problems specific to the breed. Their vision may deteriorate with age, but they are not sight-oriented dogs and they endure blindness with few noticeable changes in behavior.","The Lhasa Apso originated in the area of Tibet over 4,000 years ago as a small breed of mountain wolf.[8] They were domesticated and actively bred perhaps as long ago as 800 BC, which makes the Lhasa Apso one of the oldest recognized breeds in the world. Recent research has shown the Lhasa as one of the breeds most closely related to the ancestral wolf. (Others are Akita, Shiba Inu, Shar-Pei, Chow, Basenji, Alaskan Malamute, Siberian Husky, Saluki, Afghan, Pekingese, Shih Tzu, and Samoyed.)[9]","Lhasa Apsos are independent as well as companion dogs who want to please their owners, yet they may be suspicious toward strangers.[6] While Lhasa Apsos show loyalty to their owners, they will let their masters know when they don't want to do something. They will lie flat without moving, ""put on the brakes"" and refuse to walk forward, or try to back away. Time and patience will build the trust between the Lhasa and owner.[citation needed]","Male Lhasa Apsos should ideally be 10.75 inches (27.3 cm) at the withers and weigh about 14 to 18 pounds (6.4 to 8.2 kg). The females are slightly smaller, and weigh between 12 to 14 pounds (5.4 to 6.4 kg). The breed standard requires dark brown eyes and a black nose, although liver-colored Lhasas have a brown nose. The texture of the coat is heavy, straight, hard, neither woolly nor silky, and very dense. They come in a wide variety of colors including black, white, red and gold with various shadings. Lhasas can be with or without dark tips at the ends of ears and beard. The tail should be carried well over the dog's back. The breed standard currently used by the American Kennel Club was approved on July 11, 1978.[3]"
