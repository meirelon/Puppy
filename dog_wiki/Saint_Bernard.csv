0,Saint_Bernard,"The St. Bernard or St Bernard (/?b??rn?rd/ or /b?r?n??rd/)[2] is a breed of very large working dog from the western Alps in France, Switzerland and Italy. They were originally bred at the Great and Little St Bernard Pass[3] for rescue. The breed has become famous through tales of alpine rescues, as well as for its enormous size.",The Russian army kennels crossbreed St Bernards with Caucasian Ovcharka to produce the Moscow Watchdogs that are still used as military service dogs in Russia today.[16] St Bernards have in common many characteristics of other Mountain dog breeds.,Longhaired St. Bernards,"The name ""St. Bernard"" originates from the Great and Little St. Bernard Hospice two traveler's hospices on the often treacherous Great and Little St. Bernard Passes in the Western Alps. Between Switzerland and Italy (Pennine Alps ) and between France and Italy in the Graian Alps, south of the former one, and few miles away from the Mont-Blanc. The passes, the lodges, and the dogs are named for Bernard of Menthon, the 11th century monk who established the stations.[14]","""St. Bernard"" wasn't in widespread use until the middle of the 19th century. The dogs were called ""Saint Dogs"", ""Noble Steeds"", ""Alpenmastiff"", or ""Barry Dogs"" before that time.",A St. Bernard with short coat,"The earliest written records of the St. Bernard breed are from monks at the hospice at the Great St. Bernard Pass in 1707, with paintings and drawings of the dog dating even earlier.[6] The most famous St. Bernard to save people at the pass was Barry (sometimes spelled Berry), who reportedly saved somewhere between 40 and 100 lives. There is a monument to Barry in the Cimetière des Chiens, and his body was preserved in the Natural History Museum in Berne.[7] Another famous dog was Rutor, the faithful companion of the priest fr:Pierre Chanoux named after the peak Tête du Rutor located above the Little St Bernard pass. The classic St. Bernard looked very different from the St. Bernard of today because of cross-breeding. Severe winters from 1816 to 1818 led to increased numbers of avalanches, killing many of the dogs used for breeding while they were performing rescues.[8][9] In an attempt to preserve the breed, the remaining St. Bernards were crossed with Newfoundlands brought from the Colony of Newfoundland in the 1850s, and so lost much of their use as rescue dogs in the snowy climate of the alps because the long fur they inherited would freeze and weigh them down.[10]","The St. Bernard is a giant dog, with the largest individuals reaching over 167 kg (367 lb). The average weight of the breed is between 65 and 120 kg (140 and 260 lb) or more, and the approximate height at the withers is 70 to 90 cm (28 to 35 in).[4]",An open stud book would have allowed breeders to correct such errors by breeding in Working dog of other dog breeds.,"Eyes are usually brown, but sometimes can be icy blue, and should have naturally tight lids, with haws only slightly visible.","The breed is strikingly similar to the English Mastiff, with which it shares a common ancestor known as the Alpine Mastiff. The modern St. Bernard breed is radically different than the original dogs kept at the St. Bernard hospice, most notably by being much larger in size and build. Since the late 1800s, the St. Bernard breed has been ever refined and improved using many different large Molosser breeds, including the Newfoundland, Great Pyrenees, Greater Swiss Mountain Dog, Bernese Mountain Dog, Great Dane, English Mastiff, and possibly the Tibetan Mastiff and Caucasian Ovcharka. Other breeds such as the Rottweiler, Boxer, and English Bulldog may have contributed to the St. Bernard's bloodline as well. It is suspected that many of these large breeds were used to redevelop each other to combat the threat of their extinction after World War II, which may explain why all of them played a part in the creation of the St. Bernard as seen today.[15]","The ancestors of the St. Bernard share a history with the Sennenhunds. The St. Bernard, also called Alpine Mountain Dogs or Alpine Cattle Dogs, are the large farm dogs of the farmers and dairymen of most notably the French Alps, livestock guardians, herding dogs, and draft dogs as well as hunting dogs, search and rescue dogs, and watchdogs. These dogs are thought to be descendants of molosser type dogs brought into the Alps by the ancient Romans, and the St. Bernard is recognized internationally today as one of the Molossoid breeds.[5]","The coat can be either smooth or rough; the smooth coat being close and flat while the rough is dense, flat, and more profuse around the neck and legs. The colour is typically a red shade with white, or a mahogany brindle with white. Black shading is usually found on the face and ears.","The Swiss St. Bernard Club was founded in Basel on 15 March 1884. The St. Bernard was the very first breed entered into the Swiss Stud Book in 1884, and the breed standard was finally approved in 1888. Since then, the breed has been a Swiss national dog.[6]","The dogs at the St Bernard hospice were working dogs that were smaller than today's show St Bernard's dogs. Originally about the size of a German Shepherd Dog,[12] the St Bernard grew to the size of today's dog as kennel clubs and dog shows emphasized appearance over the dog's working ability, along with a closed stud book.[13]",St. Bernard Dog in winter,"The tail is long and heavy, hanging low.","The four Sennenhund breeds, the Grosser Schweizer Sennenhund (Greater Swiss Mountain Dog), the Berner Sennenhund, (Bernese Mountain Dog), the Appenzeller Sennenhund, (Appenzeller), and the Entlebucher Sennenhund (Entlebucher Mountain Dog) are similar in appearance and share the same location and history, but are tricolor rather than red and white.","The dogs never received any special training from the monks. Instead, younger dogs would learn how to perform search and rescue operations from older dogs.[11]"
