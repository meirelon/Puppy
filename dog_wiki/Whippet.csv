0,Whippet,"The original whippets were thought to be English Greyhounds that were too small for stag hunting in the forests of England. These dogs were frequently returned to their breeders, who were usually peasants and as such could not own hunting dogs under the forest law. Because of this, dogs returned to them were maimed, usually by cutting a tendon in a leg or removing the toes on one paw. The breeders kept these dogs and continued to breed them, producing a smaller version of a greyhound that was suited for rat catching and hunting hares and rabbits. When the forest law was repealed, the ""small greyhounds"" became immensely popular.[7][9] Whippets were then commonly known as ""snap dogs"" for their tendency to ""snap up"" nearby prey.[7] In the picture by Jean-Baptiste Oudry (1686–1755) of two dogs presented to Louis XV, they are either whippets or small greyhounds, but are probably related to an early form of whippet.[9] Oudry also painted a second painting of Misse with a different, non-sighthound dog. There is a 1758 painting by Pompeo Batoni entitled Portrait of Charles Compton, 7th Earl of Northampton which features a similar whippet-like dog.[9]","Whippets were bred to hunt by sight, coursing game in open areas at high speeds. One can find numerous representations of small greyhound-like hounds in art dating back to Ancient Egyptian times.[6] Pharaohs bred a small sighthound dog related to the greyhound to keep in their palaces, and this dog may be the ancestor of today's Whippets.[7] In medieval England, a small greyhound breed became popular for use as a ratting dog.[7] The first written English use of the word whippet with regard to a type of dog was in 1610.[8] However, the first dog to be called a Whippet was actually a greyhound-spaniel cross and has little to do with the modern Whippet.[7]","Whippet rags were a popular Sunday event in the north and Midlands at the time.[9] There were also international events; in Australia, at a track known as Gurney's Paddock, there were races of more than 300 whippets every Saturday, and three nights a week at the White City track.[18] Eventually, the sport evolved and dogs were divided into four groups: those who hunted rabbits, which was not governed by rules; those who coursed hare, for which a set of rules was established; those trained to the rag; and those trained to chase a mechanical lure in a fashion similar to greyhound races.[9] Few of the Whippets of any of the four types were purebred, as maintaining a purebred bloodline was not considered as important as breeding dogs that could win races.[9] Many racing dogs were part terrier, part Greyhound, or part Lurcher.[9]","The age of the modern Whippet dawned in 1891 when The Kennel Club granted the breed official recognition, thus making the Whippet eligible for competition in dog shows, and commencing the recording of their pedigrees.[11] In the United States, the Whippet was recognised in 1888 by the American Kennel Club.[11] Whippets arrived in the United States with mill operators from England, and the first populations were established in Massachusetts.[12] The Whippet is the 55th most popular breed according to the American Kennel Club.[13]","The Whippet (also English Whippet or Snap dog) is a dog breed of medium-size. They are a sighthound breed that originated in England, where they descended from greyhounds. Whippets today still strongly resemble a smaller greyhound. Shown in the Hound group, Whippets have relatively few health problems other than arrhythmia. Whippets also participate in dog sports such as lure coursing, agility, and flyball. The name is derived from an early 17th century word, now obsolete, meaning to ""move briskly"".[3]","Whippets were originally greyhounds that were deemed unsuitable for hunting because of their size. They were returned to their peasant breeders after being maimed so that they could not be used to hunt and break the forest law. These maimed dogs were bred together and used to catch rats, and hunt rabbits. When the forest law was repealed, these ""miniature greyhounds"" became popular in the sport of dog racing. This has led to Whippets being described as ""the poor man's racehorse.""[4] They are still frequently used as racing dogs today, as they have the highest running speed of breeds their weight: 40 miles per hour (64 km/h) and even challenge greyhounds for top speed. Whippets are, however, the fastest accelerating dog in the world.[5]","Dog racing was originally an extension of hare coursing.[18] Whippets began to be bred to race in the mid-nineteenth century.[4][9] The first form of the sport was a rudimentary form of coursing known as 'ragging', and dogs who participated were said to be 'trained to the rag'.[9] Dogs were kept on a leash by a person known as a slip, who was frequently also the race judge.[9] The slip would release the dogs from their collars at the same time, and they would race towards their owners, who were standing at the opposite end of the track waving towels.[9][18]","In the nineteenth century, Whippet racing was a major sport in England.[4][9] The Whippet was held in high regard in the northern parts of England and Wales, but was generally disregarded in the rest of the country.[9] At the time, there were two varieties of Whippet. The first type had a smooth coat, was more popular in Lancashire, Yorkshire, and the Midlands, and became the modern Whippet.[9] The other had a rough coat from crossbreeding with Bedlington Terriers, was more popular in Durham and Northumberland and was frequently referred to as a ""rabbit dog"".[9] Early specimens were taken from the race track by the dog fanciers of the time and exported around the world. John Taylor said that ""In all the shapes and forms of dogges; of all which there are but two sorts that are useful to man's profits, which two are the mastiffe and the little curre, whippet, or house-dogge; all the rest are for pleasure and recreation.""[10]","In 1964, Ch. Courtenay Fleetfoot of Pennyworth won best in show at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show.[14] In 1992, Pencloe Dutch Gold won best in show at Crufts,[15] and a Whippet known as Cobyco Call the Tune won in 2004.[16] In 2011, GCh. Starline's Chanel, a female Whippet, was chosen as the hound Show Dog of the Year by the Westminster Kennel Club.[17]"
