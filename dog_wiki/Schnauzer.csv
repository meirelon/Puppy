0,Schnauzer,"A schnauzer /??na?z?r/ (German: [??na?ts?], plural Schnauzer, lit. translation ""snouter"") is a dog breed that originated in Germany in the 15th and 16th centuries.[1] The term comes from the German word for ""snout"" and means colloquially ""moustache"",[2] because of the dog's distinctively bearded snout.[3] Although the schnauzer is considered a terrier-type dog, they do not have the typical terrier temperament.","There are three breeds: the giant, the standard, and the miniature. Toy and teacup are not breeds of schnauzer, but these common terms are used to market undersized or ill-bred miniature schnauzers.[citation needed] The original schnauzer was of the same size as the modern Standard Schnauzer breed, and was bred as a rat catcher, yard dog, and guard dog. The miniature schnauzer and the giant schnauzer were developed from the standard schnauzer and are the result of outcrosses with other breeds exhibiting the desirable characteristics needed for the schnauzer's original purpose.","Standard Schnauzers are around 1.5 ft (46 cm) tall at the shoulder and weigh 30 to 45 lb (14 to 20 kg). They are in the group of working dogs. Standard schnauzers have been used to catch rats and other rodents and as guard dogs. They have also carried messages in times of war, helped the Red Cross and been police dogs.","Miniature Schnauzers are around 1 ft (30 cm) tall at the shoulder and weigh between 14 and 20 lb (6.4 and 9.1 kg)[4] They have high energy levels and are very intelligent dogs. The American Kennel Club (AKC) approves salt and pepper, black, and black and silver as acceptable coat colors for a miniature schnauzer. They are often bred in pure white or even parti (multi) colored, but neither are approved by the AKC.[5][6] The miniature is more delicate and less robust than his cousins, and should not live outside. They make excellent pets as they are loyal companions and are rarely aggressive toward strangers, although they are quick to sound the alarm at a perceived threat. The Miniature Schnauzer is the result of crossing the original schnauzer with breeds including the poodle and the affenpinscher."
