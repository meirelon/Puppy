0,Australian_Shepherd,"The Australian Shepherd has a reputation as a highly intelligent and versatile stock dog with a range of working styles.[15] A good working Aussie is quick, thoughtful, and easy with its stock. The ability for the breed to adapt to the situation and to think for itself makes it an excellent all-around worker. For this reason, the Aussie is often chosen to work unusual livestock such as ducks, geese, and commercially raised rabbits.","The breed is typically highly energetic, requiring a great deal of exercise and attention.[8] An Australian shepherd enjoys working, whether it is learning and practicing tricks, competing in dog agility, or engaging in any other physically and mentally involving activity.[13]","There are different theories regarding the association of the breed with Australia, but there is no consensus on why it was adopted.[5] Genetic research has found that Australian Shepherds and Border Collies are closely related to each other; both are slightly more distantly related to other kinds of Collies and to Shetland Sheepdogs.[6]","Some Aussies are born with naturally bobbed tails. Others have full long tails, and others with natural partial bobs, where the tail is shorter and appears stubby. Breeders have historically docked the tails when the puppies are born. In the United States and Canada, the standard calls for a natural bob or docked tail not to exceed four inches as a defining characteristic; however, some long-tailed examples have been successfully shown and been given recognition. Any natural tail length is permitted when showing in Europe, where docking has been banned in most countries, including the United Kingdom.","The median lifespans for breeds similar in size to Australian Shepherds are mostly between 11 and 13 years,[20] so, assuming the results of the UK study are not representative of the population there, Aussies appear to have a typical lifespan for a breed their size. Leading causes of death in the UK survey were cancer (32%), ""combinations"" (18%), and old age (14%).","Aussie colors are black, red (sometimes called 'liver'), blue merle (marbled black, white, and gray), and red merle (marbled red, white, and buff);[8] each of these colors may also have copper (tan) points or white markings in various combinations on the face, chest, and legs. A black or red dog with copper and white trim is called 'tricolor' or 'tri', a black or red dog with white trim but no copper is called 'bicolor' or 'bi'. White, rather than pigment, on or around the ears is an indicator of increased risk for white-related deafness. Excessive white on the face and ears can place an individual dog at greater risk for sunburn and subsequent skin cancer.","Australian Shepherds have a medium-length, water-resistant coat. With the coat being somewhat long and wavy or curly, this breed does shed, mostly in the spring to get rid of the winter coat. The shepherd should be brushed weekly to maintain a healthy and clean coat and also to prevent matting. With being a ""working dog"", this breed should be outside to get its needed exercise. If a dog is dirty, a basic bath can be given, but not frequently, for it can dry out the skin and coat.[19]","The wide variety of color combinations comes from the interaction between the a color allele, which is either black (B) dominant or red (b) recessive, and the dominant merle allele (M). Together, these provide four coat-color aspects that can appear in any combination:[10]","The Australian Shepherd is a medium-sized breed of solid build. They can weigh from 30 to 65 pounds (14 to 29 kg) and stand from 17 to 26 inches (43 to 66 cm) in height. The Australian Shepherd Club of America (ASCA) standard calls for the Australian shepherd to stand between 18 and 23 inches (46 and 58 cm) at the withers, females being 18 to 21 inches (46 to 53 cm) and males measuring 20 to 23 inches (51 to 58 cm); however, quality is not to be sacrificed in favor of size.[1]","Also, great variety is seen in the Aussie's eye color, and they are often heterochromatic. An early nickname for the breed was ""ghost-eye dog"". Aussie eyes may be any shade of brown, or blue; they may have two differently colored eyes, or even have bicolored or ""split eyes"" (for example, a half-brown, half-blue eye), which appear to be linked to the merle coloration. Merled eyes occur, as well, where one color is mixed in and swirled with another. Any combination of eye color is acceptable in the breed standard, so long as the eyes are healthy. In general, however, black Aussies (self, bi-color, or tri-color) tend to have brown eyes, while red (self, bi-color, or tri-color) Aussies tend to have amber eyes, though these Aussies may also carry the blue-eyed gene. These dogs are also brown in color.","Dogs may show reserved and cautious guarding behaviors. They are kind, loving, and devoted to those they know. They are very loyal to their owners, and are rewarding dogs if treated well.[13] Because the breed was developed to serve on the ranch, a job which includes being protective of its property, it is inclined to bark warnings about neighborhood activity. It is not inclined toward obsessive barking.","These dogs require a minimum of two to three hours a day of play, exercise, and attention. They thrive in rural, ranch-like conditions, and need space to run and play in an urban setting. The Australian Shepherd is a high-spirited dog, that requires much attention and work. Teaching them tricks keeps them focused and happy, which also keeps their minds working. The breed also has great stamina and can live in a variety of terrain. Because of this, they are popularly used as trail and working dogs.[14]","All black and blue merle dogs have black noses, eye rims, and lips. All red and red merle dogs have liver or brown noses, eye rims, and lips.","The merle allele, which produces a mingled or patchwork combination of dark and light areas, is the coat pattern most commonly associated with the breed. This merle (M) is dominant, so heterozygous dogs (Mm) show the pigmentation pattern; however, when two merles are bred, the statistical risk is 25% of the offspring will end up with the two copies of the merle gene (homozygous). These dogs usually have a mostly white coat and blue irises, and are often deaf, blind, or both. In this case, the deafness and blindness are linked to having two copies of the merle gene, which disrupts pigmentation and produces these health defects.[12]",13–15,"The Aussie is intelligent, learns quickly, and loves to play.[14] This means that a bored, neglected, unexercised Aussie may invent its own games, activities, and jobs, which to a busy owner might appear to be hyperactivity: for example, an Aussie may go from being at rest to running at top speed for several ""laps"" around the house before returning to rest. Without something to amuse them, Aussies can become destructive. Aussies also do best with plenty of human companionship: they are often called ""Velcro dogs"" for their strong desire to always be near their owners and for their tendency to form intense, devoted bonds with select people.[13]","The recommended amount of food an Australian Shepherd should eat is 1-1/2 to 2 cups of dry food a day,[18] But size, exercise level, and age should be considered. With proper diet and exercise, the Australian Shepherd can stay in good shape.[18]","Australian Shepherd can have several health problems. Vision problems are common, and[16] epilepsy is also a concern. In merle-to-merle breeding, the puppies that have inherited two copies of the merle gene have an increased risk of being born blind and/or deaf.[17]","The Australian Shepherd, often known simply as the ""Aussie"", is a medium-sized breed of dog that was, despite its name, developed on ranches in the Western United States, during the 19th century.[2][3][4]","Aussies rose in popularity with a boom in Western riding,[why?] after World War II.[7] They became known to the general public through rodeos, horse shows, and Disney movies made for television.","For many years, Aussies have been valued by stockmen for their versatility and trainability. They have a similar look to the popular English Shepherd and Border Collie breeds. While they continue to work as stock dogs and compete in herding trials, the breed has earned recognition in other roles due to their trainability and eagerness to please and are highly regarded for their skills in obedience.[8] Like all working breeds, the Aussie has considerable energy and drive and usually needs a job to do. It often excels at dog sports such as dog agility, and frisbee. They are also highly successful search and rescue dogs, disaster dogs, detection dogs, guide dogs, service dogs, and therapy dogs. They are considered the 17th-most popular dog breed in the United States.[9]"
