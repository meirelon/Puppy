0,German_Shepherd,"Most commonly, German Shepherds are either tan/black or red/black. Most colour varieties have black masks and black body markings which can range from a classic ""saddle"" to an over-all ""blanket."" Rarer colour variations include the sable, pure-black, pure-white, liver and blue varieties. The all-black and sable varieties are acceptable according to most standards; however, the blue and liver are considered to be serious faults and the all-white is grounds for instant disqualification from showing in conformation at All Breed and Specialty Shows.[11]",German Shepherds are medium to large-sized,"The German Shepherd (German: Deutscher Schäferhund, German pronun­cia­tion: [????f??h?nt]) is a breed of medium to large-sized working dog that originated in Germany. The breed's officially recognized name is German Shepherd Dog in the English language, sometimes abbreviated as GSD and was also formerly known as the Alsatian in Britain.[5] The German Shepherd is a relatively new breed of dog, with their origin dating to 1899. As part of the Herding Group, German Shepherds are working dogs developed originally for herding sheep. Since that time however, because of their strength, intelligence, trainability, and obedience, German Shepherds around the world are often the preferred breed for many types of work, including disability assistance, search-and-rescue, police and military roles, and even acting.[6] The German Shepherd is the second-most registered breed by the American Kennel Club[7] and fourth-most registered breed by The Kennel Club in the United Kingdom.[8]",Two German Shepherds,"Well-trained and socialized German Shepherds have a reputation of being very safe. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that nearly 4.5 million people in the United States are bitten by dogs each year, but bully breeds are less often to blame than many other breeds, including chow chows and German shepherds.[20] An Australian report from 1999 provides statistics showing that German Shepherds are the breed third most likely to attack a person in some Australian locales,[21] though once their popularity is taken into account, the percentages of GSD attacks drops to 38th behind Bloodhounds (#23) and Pit Bull Terrier (#1).[22]","German Shepherds are moderately active dogs and are described in breed standards as self-assured.[11] The breed is marked by a willingness to learn and an eagerness to have a purpose. They are curious, which makes them excellent guard dogs and suitable for search missions. They can become over-protective of their family and territory, especially if not socialized correctly. They are not inclined to become immediate friends with strangers.[18] German Shepherds are highly intelligent and obedient, as well as being protective of their owners.[19]",A Female German Shepherd looks attentively at its owner,Female sable German Shepherd nursing her litter,Black German Shepherd,"German Shepherds are medium to large-sized dogs. The breed standard height at the withers is 60–65 cm (24–26 in) for males and 55–60 cm (22–24 in) for females.[1][9][10] The weight standard is 30–40 kilograms (66–88 lb) for males and 22–32 kilograms (49–71 lb) for females.[1] They have a domed forehead, a long square-cut muzzle with strong jaws and a black nose. The eyes are medium-sized and brown with a lively, intelligent and self-assured look. The ears are large and stand erect, open at the front and parallel, but they often are pulled back during movement. They have a long neck, which is raised when excited and lowered when moving at a fast pace. The tail is bushy and reaches to the hock.[9]",German Shepherd with black mask and black body markings,This 14-week-old puppy's ears are not yet erect,"German Shepherds were bred specifically for their intelligence,[14] a trait for which they are now famous.[6] In the book The Intelligence of Dogs, author Stanley Coren ranked the breed third for intelligence, behind Border Collies and Poodles.[15][16] He found that they had the ability to learn simple tasks after only five repetitions and obeyed the first command given 95% of the time.[6] Coupled with their strength, this trait makes the breed desirable as police, guard and search and rescue dogs, as they are able to quickly learn various tasks and interpret instructions better than other breeds.[17]",Displaying high levels of intelligence when completing an obstacle course for military working dogs,"German Shepherds have a two-layer coat which is close and dense with a thick undercoat. The coat is accepted in two variants; medium and long. The long-hair gene is recessive, making the long-hair variety rarer. Treatment of the long-hair variation differs across standards; they are accepted but not competed with standard coated dogs under the German and UK Kennel Clubs while they can compete with standard coated dogs but are considered a fault in the American Kennel Club.[9][11][12] The FCI accepted the long-haired type in 2010, listing it as the variety b—while short-haired type is listed as the variety a.[13]","Showing the long muzzle, black nose and brown, medium-sized eyes"
